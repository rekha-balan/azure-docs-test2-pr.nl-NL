* Dv2-series, D-series, G-series, and the DS/GS counterparts  are ideal for applications that demand faster CPUs, better local disk performance, or have higher memory demands.  They offer a powerful combination for many enterprise-grade applications.

D-series VMs are designed to run applications that demand higher compute power and temporary disk performance. D-series VMs provide faster processors, a higher memory-to-core ratio, and a solid-state drive (SSD) for the temporary disk. For details, see the announcement on the Azure blog, [New D-Series Virtual Machine Sizes](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/09/22/new-d-series-virtual-machine-sizes/).

Dv2-series, a follow-on to the original D-series, features a more powerful CPU. The Dv2-series CPU is about 35% faster than the D-series CPU. It is based on the latest generation 2.4 GHz Intel XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) processor, and with the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, can go up to 3.1 GHz. The Dv2-series has the same memory and disk configurations as the D-series.
