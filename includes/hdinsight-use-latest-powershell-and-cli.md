> Support for managing HDInsight resources by using Azure Service Manager (ASM) through Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI is **deprecated** and was removed on January 1, 2017. The steps in this document use the new Azure PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI commands that work with Azure Resource Manager.
> 
> Follow the steps in the [Install and configure Azure CLI](../articles/cli-install-nodejs.md) and [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) articles to install the latest versions. If you have existing scripts that need to be modified to use the new cmdlets or new CLI commands, see [Migrating to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](../articles/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager.md).
