In order to get a LUIS prediction in a chatbot or other application, you need to publish the app. 

You do not have to create a LUIS endpoint key in the Azure portal before you publish or before you test the endpoint URL. Every LUIS app has a free starter key for authoring. It gives you unlimited authoring and a [few endpoint hits](../articles/cognitive-services/luis/luis-boundaries.md#key-limits). 

1. Select **Publish** in the top right navigation.

2. Select the Production slot and the **Publish** button.

3. Publishing is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.
