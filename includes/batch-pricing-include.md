## <a name="pricing"></a>Pricing

Azure Batch is a free service; you aren't charged for the Batch account itself. You are charged for the underlying Azure compute resources that your Batch solutions consume, and for the resources consumed by other services when your workloads run. For example, you are charged for the compute nodes in your pools and for the data you store in Azure Storage as input or output for your tasks. Similarly, if you use the [application packages](../articles/batch/batch-application-packages.md) feature of Batch, you are charged for the Azure Storage resources used for storing your application packages. See [Batch pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/batch/) for more information.
