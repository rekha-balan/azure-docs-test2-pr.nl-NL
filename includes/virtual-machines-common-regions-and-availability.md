# <a name="regions-and-availability-for-virtual-machines-in-azure"></a>Regions and availability for virtual machines in Azure
It is important to understand how and where your virtual machines (VMs) operate in Azure, along with your options to maximize performance, availability, and redundancy. Azure operates in multiple datacenters around the world. These datacenters are grouped in to geographic regions, giving you flexibility in choosing where to build your applications. This article provides you with an overview of the availability and redundancy features of Azure.

## <a name="what-are-azure-regions"></a>What are Azure regions?
Azure allows you to create resources, such as VMs, in defined geographic regions like 'West US', 'North Europe', or 'Southeast Asia'. There are currently 30 Azure regions around the world. You can review the [list of regions and their locations](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/). Within each region, multiple datacenters exist to provide for redundancy and availability. This approach gives you flexibility when building your applications to create VMs closest to your users and to meet any legal, compliance, or tax purposes.

## <a name="special-azure-regions"></a>Special Azure regions
There are some special Azure regions for compliance or legal purposes that you may wish to use when building out your applications. These special regions include:

* **US Gov Virginia** and **US Gov Iowa**
  * A physical and logical network-isolated instance of Azure for US government agencies and partners, operated by screened US persons. Includes additional compliance certifications such as [FedRAMP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/FedRAMP) and [DISA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/DISA). Read more about [Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/gov/).
* **China East** and **China North**
  * These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft does not directly maintain the datacenters. See more about [Microsoft Azure in China](http://www.windowsazure.cn/).
* **Germany Central** and **Germany Northeast**
  * These regions are currently available via a data trustee model whereby customer data remains in Germany under control of T-Systems, a Deutsche Telekom company, acting as the German data trustee.

## <a name="region-pairs"></a>Region pairs
Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia). This approach allows for the replication of resources, such as VM storage, across a geography that should reduce the likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once. Additional advantages of region pairs include:

* In the event of a wider Azure outage, one region is prioritized out of every pair to help reduce the time to restore for applications. 
* Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
* Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

Examples of region pairs include:

| Primary | Secondary |
|:--- |:--- |
| West US |East US |
| North Europe |West Europe |
| Southeast Asia |East Asia |

You can see the full [list of regional pairs here](../articles/best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md#what-are-paired-regions).

## <a name="feature-availability"></a>Feature availability
Some services or VM features are only available in certain regions, such as specific VM sizes or storage types. There are also some global Azure services that do not require you to select a particular region, such as [Azure Active Directory](../articles/active-directory/active-directory-whatis.md), [Traffic Manager](../articles/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview.md), or [Azure DNS](../articles/dns/dns-overview.md). To assist you in designing your application environment, you can check the [availability of Azure services across each region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services). 

## <a name="storage-availability"></a>Storage availability
Understanding Azure regions and geographies becomes important when you consider the available storage replication options. Depending on the storage type, you have different replication options.

**Azure Managed Disks**
* Locally redundant storage (LRS)
  * Replicates your data three times within the region in which you created your storage account.

**Storage account-based disks**
* Locally redundant storage (LRS)
  * Replicates your data three times within the region in which you created your storage account.
* Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
  * Replicates your data three times across two to three facilities, either within a single region or across two regions.
* Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
  * Replicates your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
* Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
  * Replicates your data to a secondary region, as with GRS, but also then provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location.

The following table provides a quick overview of the differences between the storage replication types:

| Replication strategy | LRS | ZRS | GRS | RA-GRS |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Data is replicated across multiple facilities. |No |Yes |Yes |Yes |
| Data can be read from the secondary location and from the primary location. |No |No |No |Yes |
| Number of copies of data maintained on separate nodes. |3 |3 |6 |6 |

You can read more about [Azure Storage replication options here](../articles/storage/storage-redundancy.md). For more information about managed disks, see [Azure Managed Disks overview](../articles/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview.md).

### <a name="storage-costs"></a>Storage costs
Prices vary depending on the storage type and availability that you select.

**Azure Managed Disks**
* Premium Managed Disks are backed by Solid State Drives (SSDs) and Standard Managed Disks are backed by regular spinning disks. Both Premium and Standard Managed Disks are charged based on the provisioned capacity for the disk.

**Unmanaged disks**
* Premium storage is backed by Solid State Drives (SSDs) and is charged based on the capacity of the disk.
* Standard storage is backed by regular spinning disks and is charged based on the in-use capacity and desired storage availability.
  * For RA-GRS, there is an additional Geo-Replication Data Transfer charge for the bandwidth of replicating that data to another Azure region.

See [Azure Storage Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/) for pricing information on the different storage types and availability options.

## <a name="azure-images"></a>Azure images
In Azure, VMs are created from an image. Typically, images are from the [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/) where partners can provide pre-configured complete OS or application images.

When you create a VM from an image in the Azure Marketplace, you are actually working with templates. Azure Resource Manager templates are declarative JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files that can be used to create complex application environments comprising VMs, storage, virtual networking, etc. You can read more about using [Azure Resource Manager templates](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md), including how to [build your own templates](../articles/resource-group-authoring-templates.md).

You can also create your own custom images and upload them using [Azure CLI](../articles/virtual-machines/linux/upload-vhd.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) or [Azure PowerShell](../articles/virtual-machines/windows/upload-image.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) to quickly create custom VMs to your specific build requirements.

## <a name="availability-sets"></a>Availability sets
An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability. It is recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a highly available application and to meet the [99.95% Azure SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/). When a single VM is using [Azure Premium Storage](../articles/storage/storage-premium-storage.md), the Azure SLA applies for unplanned maintenance events. An availability set is compromised of two additional groupings that protect against hardware failures and allow updates to safely be applied - fault domains (FDs) and update domains (UDs).

![Conceptual drawing of the update domain and fault domain configuration](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/includes/media/virtual-machines-common-regions-and-availability/ud-fd-configuration.png)

You can read more about how to manage the availability of [Linux VMs](../articles/virtual-machines/linux/manage-availability.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) or [Windows VMs](../articles/virtual-machines/linux/manage-availability.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

### <a name="fault-domains"></a>Fault domains
A fault domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that share a common power source and network switch, similar to a rack within an on-premises datacenter. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these fault domains. This approach limits the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

#### <a name="managed-disk-fault-domains-and-availability-sets"></a>Managed Disk fault domains and availability sets
For VMs using [Azure Managed Disks](../articles/storage/storage-faq-for-disks.md), VMs are aligned with managed disk fault domains when using a managed availability set. This alignment ensures that all the managed disks attached to a VM are within the same managed disk fault domain. Only VMs with managed disks can be created in a managed availability set. The number of managed disk fault domains varies by region - either two or three managed disk fault domains per region.

### <a name="update-domains"></a>Update domains
An update domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these update domains. This approach ensures that at least one instance of your application always remains running as the Azure platform undergoes periodic maintenance. The order of update domains being rebooted may not proceed sequentially during planned maintenance, but only one update domain is rebooted at a time.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
You can now start to use these availability and redundancy features to build your Azure environment. For best practices information, see [Azure availability best practices](../articles/best-practices-availability-checklist.md).
