   * **[Resource Group](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md)**: Select **Create new** and enter a name for your new resource group. 
   * **[Hosting plan](../articles/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview.md)**, which can be one of these plans: 
     * **Consumption plan**: The default plan type for Azure Functions. When you choose a consumption plan, you must also choose the **Location**.  
     * **App Service plan**: An App Service plan requires you to create an **App Service plan/location** or select an existing one. These settings determine the [location, features, cost, and compute resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/) associated with your app.  
   * **Storage account**: Each function app requires a storage account. You can either choose an existing storage account or [create a storage account](../articles/storage/storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account).
