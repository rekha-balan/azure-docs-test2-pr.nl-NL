You can verify that your connection succeeded by using the **Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection** cmdlet, with or without **-Debug**. 

1. Use the following cmdlet example, configuring the values to match your own. If prompted, select 'A' in order to run 'All'. In the example, **-Name** refers to the name of the connection that you created and want to test.

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name MyGWConnection -ResourceGroupName MyRG
  ```
2. After the cmdlet has finished, view the values. In the example below, the connection status shows as 'Connected' and you can see ingress and egress bytes.
   
  ```
  "connectionStatus": "Connected",
  "ingressBytesTransferred": 33509044,
  "egressBytesTransferred": 4142431
  ```
