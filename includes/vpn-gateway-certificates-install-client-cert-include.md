If you want to create a P2S connection from a client computer other than the one you used to generate the client certificates, you need to install a client certificate. When installing a client certificate, you need the password that was created when the client certificate was exported.

1. Locate and copy the *.pfx* file to the client computer. On the client computer, double-click the *.pfx* file to install. Leave the **Store Location** as **Current User**, and then click **Next**.
2. On the **File** to import page, don't make any changes. Click **Next**.
3. On the **Private key protection** page, input the password for the certificate, or verify that the security principal is correct, then click **Next**.
4. On the **Certificate Store** page, leave the default location, and then click **Next**.
5. Click **Finish**. On the **Security Warning** for the certificate installation, click **Yes**. You can feel comfortable clicking 'Yes' because you generated the certificate. The certificate is now successfully imported.
