<!--
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want your virtual machine to use a virtual network so you can connect to it directly by host name or set up cross-premises connections, make sure that you specify the virtual network when you create the virtual machine. A virtual machine can be configured to join a virtual network only when you create the virtual machine. For details on virtual networks, see [Azure Virtual Network overview](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).
