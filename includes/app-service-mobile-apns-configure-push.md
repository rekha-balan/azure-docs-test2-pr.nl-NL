1. On your Mac, launch **Keychain Access**. On the left navigation bar, under **Category**, open **My Certificates**. Find the SSL certificate you downloaded in the previous section, and disclose its contents. Select only the certificate (do not select the private key), and [export it](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH20122?locale=en_US).
2. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click **Browse All** > **App Services**, and click your Mobile Apps back end. Under **Settings**, click **App Service Push**, and then click your notification hub name. Go to **Apple Push Notification Services** > **Upload Certificate**. Upload the .p12 file, selecting the correct **Mode** (depending on whether your client SSL certificate from earlier is production or sandbox). Save any changes.

Your service is now configured to work with push notifications on iOS.
