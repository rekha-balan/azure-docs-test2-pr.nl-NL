When you're done, you can delete the resource group. Deleting the resource group deletes the storage account, the Azure file share, and any other resources that you deployed inside the resource group.

1. In the left menu, select **Resource groups**.
2. Right-click the resource group, and then select **Delete resource group**. A window opens and displays a warning about the resources that will be deleted with the resource group.
3. Enter the name of the resource group, and then select **Delete**.
