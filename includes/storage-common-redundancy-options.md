Replication options for a storage account include:

* [Locally-redundant storage (LRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs.md): The simplest, low-cost replication strategy that Azure Storage offers.
* [Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs.md): A simple option for high availability and durability.
* [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md): Cross-regional replication to protect against region-wide unavailability.
* [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage): Cross-regional replication with read access to the replica.
