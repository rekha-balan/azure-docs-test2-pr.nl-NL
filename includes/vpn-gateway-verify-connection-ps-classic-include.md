You can use the **Get-AzureVNetConnection** to verify the connection for a classic virtual network gateway. 

1. Use the following cmdlet example, configuring the values to match your own. The name of the virtual network must be in quotes if it contains spaces.

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureVNetConnection "Group ClassicRG ClassicVNet"
  ```
2. After the cmdlet has finished, view the values. In the example below, the Connectivity State shows as 'Connected' and you can see ingress and egress bytes.

        ConnectivityState         : Connected
        EgressBytesTransferred    : 181664
        IngressBytesTransferred   : 182080
        LastConnectionEstablished : 1/7/2016 12:40:54 AM
        LastEventID               : 24401
        LastEventMessage          : The connectivity state for the local network site 'RMVNetLocal' changed from Connecting to
                                    Connected.
