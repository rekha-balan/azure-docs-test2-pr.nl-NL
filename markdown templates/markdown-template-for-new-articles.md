# <a name="markdown-template-for-azure-on-microsoft-docs"></a>Markdown template for Azure on Microsoft Docs

Your article should have only one H1 heading, which you create with a single # sign. The the H1 heading should always be followed by a descriptive paragraph that helps the customer understand what the article is about. It should contain keywords you think customers would use to search for this piece of content. Do not start the article with a note or tip - always start with an introductory paragraph.

## <a name="headings"></a>Headings 

Two ## signs create an H2 heading - if your article needs to be structured with headings below the H1, you need to have at least TWO H2 headings.

H2 headings are rendered on the page as an automatic on-page TOC. Do not hand-code article navigation in an article. Use the H2 headings to do that.

Within an H2 section, you can use three ### signs to create H3 headings. In our content, try to avoid going deeper than 3 heading layers - the headings are often hard to distinguish on the rendered page. 

## <a name="images"></a>Images
You can use images throughout a technical article. Make sure you include alt text for all your images. This helps accessibility and discoverability.

This image of the GitHub Octocats uses in-line image references:

 ![GitHub Octocats using inline link](./media/markdown-template-for-new-articles/octocats.png)

The sample markdown looks like this:
```
![GitHub Octocats using inline link](./media/markdown-template-for-new-articles/octocats.png)
```

This second image of the octocats uses reference style syntax, where you define the target as "5" and at the bottom of the article, and you list the path to image 5 in a reference section.

 ![GitHub Octocats using ref style link][5]

 The sample markdown looks like this:
 ```
  ![GitHub Octocats image][5]

  <!--Image references-->
  [5]: ./media/markdown-template-for-new-articles/octocats.png
 ``` 

## <a name="linking"></a>Linking
Your article will most likely contain links. Here's sample markdown for a link to a target that is not on the docs.microsoft.com site:

    [link text](url)
    [Scott Guthrie's blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu)

Here's sample markdown for a link to another technical article in the azure-docs-pr repository:

    [link text](../service-directory/article-name.md)
    [ExpressRoute circuits and routing domains](../expressroute/expressroute-circuit-peerings.md)

You can also use so-called reference style links where you define the links at the bottom of the article, and reference them like this:

    I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][gog] than from [Yahoo][yah] or [MSN][msn].

For more information about linking, see the [linking guidance](../contributor-guide/create-links-markdown.md)

## <a name="notes-and-tips"></a>Notes and tips
You should use notes and tips judiciously. A little bit goes a long way. Put the text of the note or tip on the line after the custom markdown extension.

```
> [!NOTE]
> Note text.

> [!TIP]
> Tip text.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Important text.
```

## <a name="lists"></a>Lists

A simple numbered list in markdown creates a numbered list on your published page.

1. First step.
2. Second step.
3. Third step.

Use hyphens to create unordered lists:

- Item
- Item
- Item


## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
Every topic should end with 1 to 3 concrete, action oriented next steps and links to the next logical piece of content to keep the customer engaged. 

- See the [content quality guidelines](../contributor-guide/contributor-guide-pr-criteria.md#non-blocking-content-quality-items) for an example of what a good next steps section looks like. 

- Review the [custom markdown extensions](../contributor-guide/custom-markdown-extensions.md) we use for videos, reusable content, selectors, and other content features.

- Make sure your articles meet [the content quality guidelines](../contributor-guide/contributor-guide-pr-criteria.md) before you sign-off on a PR.
