# <a name="live-metrics-stream-instant-metrics-for-close-monitoring"></a>Live Metrics Stream: instant metrics for close monitoring
Live Metrics Stream shows you your [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) metrics right at this very moment, with a near-real-time latency of one second. This immediate monitoring is very useful when youâ€™re releasing a new build and want to make sure that everything is working as expected, or investigating an incident in real time.

Unlike [Metrics Explorer](app-insights-metrics-explorer.md), Live Metrics Stream displays a fixed set of metrics. The data persists only for as long as it's on the chart, and is then discarded.

Live Metrics Stream data is free: it doesn't add to your bill. It is available for ASP.NET and Java applications.

![In the Overview blade, click Live Stream](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/application-insights/media/app-insights-live-stream/live-stream.png)



## <a name="live-failures"></a>Live failures

If any failures or exceptions are logged, Live Stream picks out a sample of them. Click **Pause** to hold a specific sample, and select an event to show its details.

Live Metrics Stream is available with the latest version of [Application Insights SDK for web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web/).

## <a name="filter-by-server-instance"></a>Filter by server instance

If you want to monitor a particular server role instance, you can filter by server.

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

No data? Live Metrics Stream uses a different port than other Application Insights telemetry. Make sure [those ports](app-insights-ip-addresses.md) are open in your firewall.
