# <a name="configure-an-application-gateway-for-ssl-offload-by-using-azure-resource-manager"></a>Configure an application gateway for SSL offload by using Azure Resource Manager

Azure Application Gateway can be configured to terminate the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) session at the gateway to avoid costly SSL decryption tasks to happen at the web farm. SSL offload also simplifies the front-end server setup and management of the web application.

## <a name="before-you-begin"></a>Before you begin

1. Install the latest version of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets by using the Web Platform Installer. You can download and install the latest version from the **Windows PowerShell** section of the [Downloads page](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. You create a virtual network and a subnet for the application gateway. Make sure that no virtual machines or cloud deployments are using the subnet. Application Gateway must be by itself in a virtual network subnet.
3. The servers you configure to use the application gateway must exist or have their endpoints created either in the virtual network or with a public IP/VIP assigned.

## <a name="what-is-required-to-create-an-application-gateway"></a>What is required to create an application gateway?

* **Back-end server pool:** The list of IP addresses of the back-end servers. The IP addresses listed should either belong to the virtual network subnet or should be a public IP/VIP.
* **Back-end server pool settings:** Every pool has settings like port, protocol, and cookie-based affinity. These settings are tied to a pool and are applied to all servers within the pool.
* **Front-end port:** This port is the public port that is opened on the application gateway. Traffic hits this port, and then gets redirected to one of the back-end servers.
* **Listener:** The listener has a front-end port, a protocol (Http or Https, these settings are case-sensitive), and the SSL certificate name (if configuring SSL offload).
* **Rule:** The rule binds the listener and the back-end server pool and defines which back-end server pool the traffic should be directed to when it hits a particular listener. Currently, only the *basic* rule is supported. The *basic* rule is round-robin load distribution.

**Additional configuration notes**

For SSL certificates configuration, the protocol in **HttpListener** should change to *Https* (case sensitive). The **SslCertificate** element is added to **HttpListener** with the variable value configured for the SSL certificate. The front-end port should be updated to 443.

**To enable cookie-based affinity**: An application gateway can be configured to ensure that a request from a client session is always directed to the same VM in the web farm. This scenario is done by injection of a session cookie that allows the gateway to direct traffic appropriately. To enable cookie-based affinity, set **CookieBasedAffinity** to *Enabled* in the **BackendHttpSettings** element.

## <a name="create-an-application-gateway"></a>Create an application gateway

The difference between using the Azure Classic deployment model and Azure Resource Manager is the order that you create an application gateway and the items that need to be configured.

With Resource Manager, all components of an application gateway are configured individually and then put together to create an application gateway resource.

Here are the steps needed to create an application gateway:

1. Create a resource group for Resource Manager
2. Create virtual network, subnet, and public IP for the application gateway
3. Create an application gateway configuration object
4. Create an application gateway resource

## <a name="create-a-resource-group-for-resource-manager"></a>Create a resource group for Resource Manager

Make sure that you switch PowerShell mode to use the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets. More info is available at [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).

### <a name="step-1"></a>Step 1

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

### <a name="step-2"></a>Step 2

Check the subscriptions for the account.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmSubscription
```

You are prompted to authenticate with your credentials.

### <a name="step-3"></a>Step 3

Choose which of your Azure subscriptions to use.

```powershell
Select-AzureRmSubscription -Subscriptionid "GUID of subscription"
```

### <a name="step-4"></a>Step 4

Create a resource group (skip this step if you're using an existing resource group).

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name appgw-rg -Location "West US"
```

Azure Resource Manager requires that all resource groups specify a location. This setting is used as the default location for resources in that resource group. Make sure that all commands to create an application gateway uses the same resource group.

In the example above, we created a resource group called **appgw-RG** and location **West US**.

## <a name="create-a-virtual-network-and-a-subnet-for-the-application-gateway"></a>Create a virtual network and a subnet for the application gateway

The following example shows how to create a virtual network by using Resource Manager:

### <a name="step-1"></a>Step 1

```powershell
$subnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name subnet01 -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
```

This sample assigns the address range 10.0.0.0/24 to a subnet variable to be used to create a virtual network.

### <a name="step-2"></a>Step 2

```powershell
$vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name appgwvnet -ResourceGroupName appgw-rg -Location "West US" -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $subnet
```

This sample creates a virtual network named **appgwvnet** in resource group **appgw-rg** for the West US region using the prefix 10.0.0.0/16 with subnet 10.0.0.0/24.

### <a name="step-3"></a>Step 3

```powershell
$subnet = $vnet.Subnets[0]
```

This sample assigns the subnet object to variable $subnet for the next steps.

## <a name="create-a-public-ip-address-for-the-front-end-configuration"></a>Create a public IP address for the front-end configuration

```powershell
$publicip = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName appgw-rg -name publicIP01 -location "West US" -AllocationMethod Dynamic
```

This sample creates a public IP resource **publicIP01** in resource group **appgw-rg** for the West US region.

## <a name="create-an-application-gateway-configuration-object"></a>Create an application gateway configuration object

### <a name="step-1"></a>Step 1

```powershell
$gipconfig = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayIPConfiguration -Name gatewayIP01 -Subnet $subnet
```

This sample creates an application gateway IP configuration named **gatewayIP01**. When Application Gateway starts, it picks up an IP address from the subnet configured and route network traffic to the IP addresses in the back-end IP pool. Keep in mind that each instance takes one IP address.

### <a name="step-2"></a>Step 2

```powershell
$pool = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool -Name pool01 -BackendIPAddresses 134.170.185.46, 134.170.188.221,134.170.185.50
```

This sample configures the back-end IP address pool named **pool01** with IP addresses **134.170.185.46**, **134.170.188.221**, **134.170.185.50**. Those values are the IP addresses that receive the network traffic that comes from the front-end IP endpoint. Replace the IP addresses from the preceding example with the IP addresses of your web application endpoints.

### <a name="step-3"></a>Step 3

```powershell
$poolSetting = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendHttpSettings -Name poolsetting01 -Port 80 -Protocol Http -CookieBasedAffinity Enabled
```

This sample configures application gateway setting **poolsetting01** to load-balanced network traffic in the back-end pool.

### <a name="step-4"></a>Step 4

```powershell
$fp = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayFrontendPort -Name frontendport01  -Port 443
```

This sample configures the front-end IP port named **frontendport01** for the public IP endpoint.

### <a name="step-5"></a>Step 5

```powershell
$cert = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySslCertificate -Name cert01 -CertificateFile <full path for certificate file> -Password "<password>"
```

This sample configures the certificate used for SSL connection. The certificate needs to be in .pfx format, and the password must be between 4 to 12 characters.

### <a name="step-6"></a>Step 6

```powershell
$fipconfig = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig -Name fipconfig01 -PublicIPAddress $publicip
```

This sample creates the front-end IP configuration named **fipconfig01** and associates the public IP address with the front-end IP configuration.

### <a name="step-7"></a>Step 7

```powershell
$listener = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayHttpListener -Name listener01  -Protocol Https -FrontendIPConfiguration $fipconfig -FrontendPort $fp -SslCertificate $cert
```

This sample creates the listener name **listener01** and associates the front-end port to the front-end IP configuration and certificate.

### <a name="step-8"></a>Step 8

```powershell
$rule = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayRequestRoutingRule -Name rule01 -RuleType Basic -BackendHttpSettings $poolSetting -HttpListener $listener -BackendAddressPool $pool
```

This sample creates the load balancer routing rule named **rule01** that configures the load balancer behavior.

### <a name="step-9"></a>Step 9

```powershell
$sku = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySku -Name Standard_Small -Tier Standard -Capacity 2
```

This sample configures the instance size of the application gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> The default value for *InstanceCount* is 2, with a maximum value of 10. The default value for *GatewaySize* is Medium. You can choose between Standard_Small, Standard_Medium, and Standard_Large.

## <a name="create-an-application-gateway-by-using-new-azureapplicationgateway"></a>Create an application gateway by using New-AzureApplicationGateway

```powershell
$appgw = New-AzureRmApplicationGateway -Name appgwtest -ResourceGroupName appgw-rg -Location "West US" -BackendAddressPools $pool -BackendHttpSettingsCollection $poolSetting -FrontendIpConfigurations $fipconfig  -GatewayIpConfigurations $gipconfig -FrontendPorts $fp -HttpListeners $listener -RequestRoutingRules $rule -Sku $sku -SslCertificates $cert
```

This sample creates an application gateway with all configuration items from the preceding steps. In the example, the application gateway is called **appgwtest**.

## <a name="get-application-gateway-dns-name"></a>Get application gateway DNS name

Once the gateway is created, the next step is to configure the front end for communication. When using a public IP, application gateway requires a dynamically assigned DNS name, which is not friendly. To ensure end users can hit the application gateway a CNAME record can be used to point to the public endpoint of the application gateway. [Configuring a custom domain name for in Azure](../cloud-services/cloud-services-custom-domain-name-portal.md). To do this, retrieve details of the application gateway and its associated IP/DNS name using the PublicIPAddress element attached to the application gateway. The application gateway's DNS name should be used to create a CNAME record, which points the two web applications to this DNS name. The use of A-records is not recommended since the VIP may change on restart of application gateway.


```powershell
Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName appgw-RG -Name publicIP01
```

```
Name                     : publicIP01
ResourceGroupName        : appgw-RG
Location                 : westus

                            Configurations/frontend1"
                            }
DnsSettings              : {
                                "Fqdn": "00000000-0000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudapp.net"
                            }
```
