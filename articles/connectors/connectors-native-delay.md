# <a name="get-started-with-the-delay-and-delay-until-actions"></a>Get started with the delay and delay-until actions
By using the delay and "delay-until" actions, you can complete workflow scenarios.

For example, you can:

* Wait until a weekday to send a status update over email.
* Delay the workflow until an HTTP call has time to finish before resuming and retrieving the result.

To get started using the delay action in a logic app, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md).

## <a name="use-the-delay-actions"></a>Use the delay actions
An action is an operation that is carried out by the workflow that is defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions](connectors-overview.md).

Hereâ€™s an example sequence of how to use a delay step in a logic app:

1. After adding a trigger, click **New Step** to add an action.
2. Search for **delay** to bring up the delay actions. In this example, we will select **Delay**.
   
    ![Delay actions](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/connectors/media/connectors-native-delay/using-action-1.png)
3. Complete any of the action properties to configure the delay.
   
    ![Delay config](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/connectors/media/connectors-native-delay/using-action-2.png)
4. Click **Save** to publish and activate the logic app.

## <a name="action-details"></a>Action details
The recurrence trigger has the following properties that can be configured.

### <a name="delay-action"></a>Delay action
This action delays the run for a certain time interval.
A * means that it is a required field.

| Display name | Property name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Count* |count |The number of time units to delay |
| Unit* |unit |The unit of time: `Second`, `Minute`, `Hour`, or `Day` |

<br>

### <a name="delay-until-action"></a>Delay-until action
This action delays the run until a specified date/time.
A * means that it is a required field.

| Display name | Property name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Year* |timestamp |The year to delay until (GMT) |
| Month* |timestamp |The month to delay until (GMT) |
| Day* |timestamp |The day to delay until (GMT) |

Now, try out the platform and [create a logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md). You can explore the other available connectors in logic apps by looking at our [APIs list](apis-list.md).
