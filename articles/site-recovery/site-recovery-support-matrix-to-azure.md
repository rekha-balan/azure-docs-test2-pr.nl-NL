Virtual machines that are protected must meet [Azure requirements](#failed-over-azure-vm-requirements) when replicating to Azure.
The following table summarizes replicated operating system support in various deployment scenarios while using Azure Site Recovery. This support is applicable for any workload running on the mentioned OS.

 **VMware/physical server** | **Hyper-V (with/without Virtual Machine Manager)** |
--- | --- |
64-bit Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 with at least SP1<br/><br/> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, 6.8, 7.1, 7.2 <br/><br/> CentOS 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 <br/><br/> Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4, 6.5 running either the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3) <br/><br/> SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 <br/><br/> SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 <br/>(Upgrade of replicating machines from SLES 11 SP3 to SLES 11 SP4 is not supported. If a replicated machine has been upgraded from SLES 11SP3 to SLES 11 SP4, you'll need to disable replication and protect the machine again post the upgrade.) | Any guest OS [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868.aspx)


>[!IMPORTANT]
>(Applicable to VMware/Physical servers replicating to Azure)
>
> On Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7+ and CentOS 7+ servers, kernel version 3.10.0-514 is supported starting from version 9.8 of the Azure Site Recovery mobility service.<br/><br/>
> Customers on the 3.10.0-514 kernel with a version of the mobility service lower than version 9.8 are required to disable replication, update the version of the mobility service to version 9.8 and then enable replication again.  

## <a name="supported-file-systems-and-guest-storage-configurations-on-linux-vmwarephysical-servers"></a>Supported file systems and guest storage configurations on Linux (VMware/Physical servers)

The following file systems and storage configuration software is supported on Linux servers running on VMware or Physical servers:
* File systems: ext3, ext4, ReiserFS (Suse Linux Enterprise Server only), XFS (upto v4 only)
* Volume manger : LVM2
* Multipath software : Device Mapper

Physical servers with the HP CCISS storage controller aren't supported.

>[!Note]
> On Linux servers the following directories (if set up as separate partitions/file-systems) must all be on the same disk (the OS disk) on the source server:   / (root), /boot, /usr, /usr/local, /var, /etc<br/><br/>
> XFS v5 features such as metadata checksum are currently not supported by ASR on XFS filesystems. Ensure that your XFS filesystems aren't using any v5 features. You can use the xfs_info utility to check the XFS superblock for the partition. If ftype is set to 1, then XFSv5 features are being used.

You can deploy Site Recovery to replicate virtual machines and physical servers running any operating system supported by Azure. This includes most versions of Windows and Linux. On-premises VMs that you want to replicate must conform with the following Azure requirements while replicating to Azure.

**Entity** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
**Guest operating system** | Hyper-V to Azure replication: Site Recovery supports all operating systems that are [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868%28v=ws.10%29.aspx). <br/><br/> For VMware and physical server replication: Check the Windows and Linux [prerequisites](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md#before-you-start-deployment) | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Guest operating system architecture** | 64-bit | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Operating system disk size** | Up to 1023 GB | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Operating system disk count** | 1 | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Data disk count** | 64 or less if you are replicating **VMware VMs to Azure**; 16 or less if you are replicating **Hyper-V VMs to Azure** | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Data disk VHD size** | Up to 1023 GB | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Network adapters** | Multiple adapters are supported |
**Shared VHD** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**FC disk** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Hard disk format** | VHD <br/><br/> VHDX | Although VHDX isn't currently supported in Azure, Site Recovery automatically converts VHDX to VHD when you fail over to Azure. When you fail back to on-premises the virtual machines continue to use the VHDX format.
**Bitlocker** | Not supported | Bitlocker must be disabled before protecting a virtual machine.
**VM name** | Between 1 and 63 characters. Restricted to letters, numbers, and hyphens. The VM name must start and end with a letter or number. | Update the value in the virtual machine properties in Site Recovery.
**VM type** | Generation 1<br/><br/> Generation 2 -- Windows | Generation 2 VMs with an OS disk type of basic (which includes one or two data volumes formatted as VHDX) and less than 300 GB of disk space are supported.<br></br>Linux Generation 2 VMs aren't supported.
