# <a name="replicate-physical-machines-to-azure-with-azure-site-recovery-using-the-azure-portal"></a>Replicate physical machines to Azure with Azure Site Recovery using the Azure portal


Welcome to the Azure Site Recovery service!

Site Recovery is an Azure service that contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy. Site Recovery orchestrates replication of on-premises physical servers and virtual machines to the cloud (Azure), or to a secondary datacenter. When outages occur in your primary location, you fail over to the secondary location to keep apps and workloads available. You fail back to your primary location when it returns to normal operations. Learn more in [What is Azure Site Recovery?](site-recovery-overview.md)

This article describes how to replicate on-premises Windows/Linux physical servers to Azure, using Azure Site Recovery in the Azure portal.

## <a name="steps"></a>Steps

Here's what you need to do:

1. Verify prerequisites and limitations.
2. Set up Azure network and storage accounts.
3. Prepare the on-premises machine that you want to deploy as the configuration server.
4. Create a Recovery Services vault. The vault contains configuration settings, and orchestrates replication.
5. Specify source, target, and replication settings.
6. Deploy the Mobility service on VMs you want to replicate.
7. Enable replication for the VMs.
7. Run a test failover to make sure everything's working as expected

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

**Support requirement** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Azure** | Learn about [Azure requirements](site-recovery-prereq.md#azure-requirements)
**On-premises configuration server** | On-premises machine running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later. You set up this server during Site Recovery deployment.<br/><br/> By default the process server and master target server are also installed on this VM. When you scale up, you might need a separate process server, and it has the same requirements as the configuration server.<br/><br/> Learn more about these components [here](site-recovery-set-up-vmware-to-azure.md#configuration-server-minimum-requirements)
**On-premises VMs** | VMs you want to replicate should be running a [supported operating system](site-recovery-support-matrix-to-azure.md#support-for-replicated-machine-os-versions), and conform with [Azure prerequisites](site-recovery-support-matrix-to-azure.md#failed-over-azure-vm-requirements).
**URLs** | The configuration server needs access to these URLs:<br/><br/> [!INCLUDE [site-recovery-URLS](../../includes/site-recovery-URLS.md)]<br/><br/> If you have IP address-based firewall rules, ensure they allow communication to Azure.<br/></br> Allow the [Azure Datacenter IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=41653), and the HTTPS (443) port.<br/></br> Allow IP address ranges for the Azure region of your subscription, and for West US (used for Access Control and Identity Management).<br/><br/> Allow this URL for the MySQL download: http://cdn.mysql.com/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi.
**Mobility service** | Installed on every replicated VM.


## <a name="site-recovery-in-the-azure-portal"></a>Site recovery in the Azure portal
Azure has two different [deployment models](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md) for creating and working with resources – Azure Resource Manager and classic. Azure also has two portals – the Azure classic portal and Azure portal.

This article describes how to deploy in the Azure portal, which provides new features and a streamlined deployment experience. The classic portal can be used to maintain existing vaults. You can't create new vaults using the classic portal.


## <a name="set-up-azure"></a>Set up Azure

1. [Set up an Azure network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal.md).
    - Azure VMs will be placed in this network when they're created after failover.
    - You can set up a network in [Resource Manager](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md), or in classic mode.

2. Set up an [Azure storage account](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account) for replicated data.
    - The account can be standard or [premium](../storage/storage-premium-storage.md).
    - You can set up an account in Resource Manager, or in classic mode.

## <a name="prepare-the-configuration-server"></a>Prepare the configuration server

1. Install Windows Server 2012 R2 or later, on an on-premises server.
2. Make sure the VM has access the URLs listed in [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

**Prepare an account to push the Mobility service**: If you want to push the Mobility service to VMs, you need an account that can be used by the process server to access the VM. The account is only used for the push installation. You can use a domain or local account:

  - For Windows, if you're not using a domain account, you need to disable Remote User Access control on the local machine. To do this, in the register under **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System**, add the DWORD entry **LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy**, with a value of 1.
    - If you want to add the registry entry for Windows from a CLI, type:   ``REG ADD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1.``
  - For Linux, the account should be a root user on the source Linux server.

[!INCLUDE [site-recovery-create-vault](../../includes/site-recovery-create-vault.md)]

## <a name="select-the-protection-goal"></a>Select the protection goal

Select what you want to replicate, and where you want to replicate to.

1. Click **Recovery Services vaults** > vault.
2. In the Resource Menu > click **Site Recovery** > **Step 1: Prepare Infrastructure** > **Protection goal**.

    ![Choose goals](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/choose-goal-physical.png)
3. In **Protection goal**, select **To Azure**, and select **Not virtualized/other**.


## <a name="set-up-the-source-environment"></a>Set up the source environment

Set up the configuration server, register it in the vault, and discover VMs.

1. Click **Site Recovery** > **Step 1: Prepare Infrastructure** > **Source**.
2. If you don’t have a configuration server, click **+Configuration server**.

    ![Set up source](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/set-source1.png)
3. In **Add Server**, check that **Configuration Server** appears in **Server type**.
4. Download the Site Recovery Unified Setup installation file.
5. Download the vault registration key. You need this when you run Unified Setup. The key is valid for five days after you generate it.

   ![Set up source](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/set-source2.png)
6. On configuration server VM, make sure that the system clock is synchronized with a [Time Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/identity/ad-ds/get-started/windows-time-service/windows-time-service), and then run Unified Setup to install the configuration server, the process server, and the master target server.

## <a name="run-site-recovery-unified-setup"></a>Run Site Recovery Unified Setup

Before you start:

- Make sure that the time on the VM is the same as the time in your local time zone. It should match. If it's 15 minutes in front or behind, setup might fail.
- Run setup as a Local Administrator on the configuration server VM.
- Make sure TLS 1.0 is enabled on the VM.

Then run the Unified Setup installation file on the configuration server.


[!INCLUDE [site-recovery-add-configuration-server](../../includes/site-recovery-add-configuration-server.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration server can be installed via command line. For more information, see [Installing the configuration server using Command-line tools](http://aka.ms/installconfigsrv).

## <a name="set-up-the-target"></a>Set up the target

Before you set up the target environment, check you have an [Azure storage account and network](#set-up-azure)

1. Click **Prepare infrastructure** > **Target**, and select the Azure subscription you want to use.
2. Specify whether your target deployment model is Resource Manager-based, or classic.
3. Site Recovery checks that you have one or more compatible Azure storage accounts and networks.

   ![Target](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/gs-target.png)
4. If you haven't created a storage account or network, click **+Storage account** or **+Network**, to create a Resource Manager account or network inline.

## <a name="set-up-replication-settings"></a>Set up replication settings

1. To create a new replication policy, click **Site Recovery infrastructure** > **Replication Policies** > **+Replication Policy**.
2. In **Create replication policy**, specify a policy name.
3. In **RPO threshold**, specify the RPO limit. This value specifies how often data recovery points are created. An alert is generated if continuous replication exceeds this limit.
4. In **Recovery point retention**, specify (in hours) how long the retention window is for each recovery point. Replicated VMs can be recovered to any point in a window. Up to 24 hours retention is supported for machines replicated to premium storage, and 72 hours for standard storage.
5. In **App-consistent snapshot frequency**, specify how often (in minutes) recovery points containing application-consistent snapshots will be created. Click **OK** to create the policy.

    ![Replication policy](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/gs-replication2.png)
8. When you create a new policy it's automatically associated with the configuration server. By default, a matching policy is automatically created for failback. For example if the replication policy is **rep-policy** then the failback policy will be **rep-policy-failback**. This policy isn't used until you initiate a failback from Azure.  


## <a name="plan-capacity"></a>Plan capacity

1. Now that you have your basic infrastructure set up you can think about capacity planning, and figure out whether you need additional resources. [Learn more](site-recovery-plan-capacity-vmware.md).
2. When you’re done with capacity planning, select **Yes** in **Have you completed capacity planning?**

   ![Capacity planning](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/gs-capacity-planning.png)


## <a name="prepare-vms-for-replication"></a>Prepare VMs for replication

All machines that you want to replicate must have the Mobility service installed. You can install the Mobility service in a number of ways:

1. Install with a push installation from the process server. You need to prepare VMs to use this method.
2. Install using deployment tools such as System Center Configuration Manager, or Azure automation DSC.
3.  Install manually.

[Learn more](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-install-mob-svc.md)


## <a name="enable-replication"></a>Enable replication

Before you start:

- When you add or modify VMs, it can take up to 15 minutes or longer for changes to take effect, and for them to appear in the portal.
- You can check the last discovered time for VMs in **Configuration Servers** > **Last Contact At**.
- To add VMs without waiting for the scheduled discovery, highlight the configuration server (don’t click it), and click **Refresh**.
* If a VM is prepared for push installation, the process server automatically installs the Mobility service when you enable replication.


### <a name="exclude-disks-from-replication"></a>Exclude disks from replication

By default all disks on a machine are replicated. You can exclude disks from replication. For example you might not want to replicate disks with temporary data, or data that's refreshed each time a machine or application restarts (for example pagefile.sys or SQL Server tempdb).

### <a name="replicate-vms"></a>Replicate VMs

1. Click **Step 2: Replicate application** > **Source**.
2. In **Source**, select On-premises
3. In **Source-location**, select the configuration server name
4. In **Machine type**, select **Physical Machines**.
4. In **vCenter/vSphere Hypervisor**, select the vCenter server that manages the vSphere host, or select the host.
5. In **Process server** choose the Process server. If you haven't created any additional process servers this will be the configuration server. Then click **OK**.

    ![Enable replication](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-physical-to-azure/ChooseVM.PNG)

6. In **Target**, select the subscription and the resource group in which you want to create the failed over VMs. Choose the deployment model that you want to use in Azure (classic or resource management), for the failed over VMs.

7. Select the Azure storage account you want to use for replicating data. If you don't want to use an account you've already set up, you can create a new one.

8. Select the Azure network and subnet to which Azure VMs will connect, when they're created after failover. Select **Configure now for selected machines**, to apply the network setting to all machines you select for protection. Select **Configure later** to select the Azure network per machine. If you don't want to use an existing network, you can create one.

    ![Enable replication](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-physical-to-azure/targetsettings.PNG)
9. In **Physical Machines**, Click the '+' button and enter **Name**, **IP address** and choose OS type of the machine you want to replicate.
  ![Enable replication](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-physical-to-azure/machineselect.PNG) You'd need to wait for a few minutes before the machines are discoverd and shown in the list.

10. In **Properties** > **Configure properties**, select the account that will be used by the process server to automatically install the Mobility service on the machine.
11. By default all disks are replicated. Click **All Disks** and clear any disks you don't want to replicate. Then click **OK**. You can set additional VM properties later.

    ![Enable replication](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-physical-to-azure/configprop.PNG)
11. In **Replication settings** > **Configure replication settings**, verify that the correct replication policy is selected. If you modify a policy, changes will be applied to replicating machine, and to new machines.
12. Enable **Multi-VM consistency** if you want to gather machines into a replication group, and specify a name for the group. Then click **OK**. Note that:

    * Machines in replication groups replicate together, and have shared crash-consistent and app-consistent recovery points when they fail over.
    * We recommend that you gather VMs and physical servers together so that they mirror your workloads. Enabling multi-VM consistency can impact workload performance, and should only be used if machines are running the same workload and you need consistency.
    ![Enable replication](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-physical-to-azure/policy.PNG)

13. Click **Enable Replication**. You can track progress of the **Enable Protection** job in **Settings** > **Jobs** > **Site Recovery Jobs**. After the **Finalize Protection** job runs the machine is ready for failover.

After you enable replication, the Mobility service will be installed if you set up push installation. After the Mobility service is push installed on a VM, a protection job will start and fail. After the failure you need to manually restart each machine. Then the protection job begins again, and initial replication occurs.


### <a name="view-and-manage-vm-properties"></a>View and manage VM properties

We recommend that you verify the VM properties, and make any changes you need to.

1. Click **Replicated items** >, and select the machine. The **Essentials** blade shows information about machines settings and status.
2. In **Properties**, you can view replication and failover information for the VM.
3. In **Compute and Network** > **Compute properties**, you can specify the Azure VM name and target size. Modify the name to comply with [Azure requirements](site-recovery-support-matrix-to-azure.md#failed-over-azure-vm-requirements) if you need to.
4. Modify settings for the target network, subnet, and IP address that will be assigned to the Azure VM:

   - You can set the target IP address.

    - If you don't provide an address, the failed over machine will use DHCP.
    - If you set an address that isn't available at failover, failover won't work.
    - The same target IP address can be used for test failover, if the address is available in the test failover network.

   - The number of network adapters is dictated by the size you specify for the target virtual machine:

     - If the number of network adapters on the source machine is the same as, or less than, the number of adapters allowed for the target machine size, then the target will have the same number of adapters as the source.
     - If the number of adapters for the source virtual machine exceeds the number allowed for the target size, then the target size maximum will be used.
     - For example, if a source machine has two network adapters and the target machine size supports four, the target machine will have two adapters. If the source machine has two adapters but the supported target size only supports one then the target machine will have only one adapter.     
   - If the virtual machine has multiple network adapters they will all connect to the same network.
   - If the virtual machine has multiple network adapters then the first one shown in the list becomes the *Default* network adapter in the Azure virtual machine.
5. In **Disks**, you can see the VM operating system, and the data disks that will be replicated.

## <a name="run-a-test-failover"></a>Run a test failover

After you've set everything up, run a test failover to make sure everything's working as expected.


1. To fail over a single machine, in **Settings** > **Replicated Items**, click the VM > **+Test Failover** icon.

    ![Test failover](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/TestFailover.png)

1. To fail over a recovery plan, in **Settings** > **Recovery Plans**, right-click the plan > **Test Failover**. To create a recovery plan, [follow these instructions](site-recovery-create-recovery-plans.md).  

1. In **Test Failover**, select the Azure network to which Azure VMs will be connected after failover occurs.

1. Click **OK** to begin the failover. You can track progress by clicking on the VM to open its properties, or on the **Test Failover** job in vault name > **Settings** > **Jobs** > **Site Recovery jobs**.

1. After the failover completes, you should also be able to see the replica Azure machine appear in the Azure portal > **Virtual Machines**. You should make sure that the VM is the appropriate size, that it's connected to the appropriate network, and that it's running.

1. If you [prepared for connections after failover](site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure.md#prepare-to-connect-to-azure-vms-after-failover), you should be able to connect to the Azure VM.

1. Once you're done, click on **Cleanup test failover** on the recovery plan. In **Notes** record and save any observations associated with the test failover. This will delete the virtual machines that were created during test failover.

For more details, refer to [Test failover to Azure](site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure.md) document.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

After you get replication up and running, when an outage occurs you fail over to Azure, and Azure VMs are created from the replicated data. You can then access workloads and apps in Azure, until you fail back to your primary location when it returns to normal operations.

- [Learn more](site-recovery-failover.md) about different types of failovers, and how to run them.
- If you're migrating machines rather than replicating and failing back, [read more](site-recovery-migrate-to-azure.md#migrate-on-premises-vms-and-physical-servers).
- When replicating physical machines, you can only failback to a VMWare environment. [Read about failback](site-recovery-failback-azure-to-vmware.md).
