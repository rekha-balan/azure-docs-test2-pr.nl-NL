The Azure Site Recovery service contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy by orchestrating replication, failover, and recovery of virtual machines and physical servers. Machines can be replicated to Azure or to a secondary on-premises data center. For a quick overview, see [What is Azure Site Recovery?](site-recovery-overview.md).

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
This article describes how to:

* **Replicate VMware virtual machines to Azure**: Deploy Site Recovery to coordinate replication, failover, and recovery of on-premises VMware virtual machines to Azure storage.
* **Replicate physical servers to Azure**: Deploy Azure Site Recovery to coordinate replication, failover, and recovery of on-premises physical Windows and Linux servers to Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to replicate to Azure. If you want to replicate VMware VMs or Windows/Linux physical servers to a secondary datacenter, see [Site Recovery VMware to VMware](site-recovery-vmware-to-vmware.md).

## <a name="enhanced-deployment"></a>Enhanced deployment
This article includes instructions for an enhanced deployment in the Azure classic portal. We recommend that you use this version for all new deployments. If you've already deployed by using the earlier legacy version, we recommend that you migrate to the new version. For more about migration, see [Site Recovery VMware to Azure classic legacy](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic-legacy.md#migrate-to-the-enhanced-deployment).

The enhanced deployment is a major update. Here's a summary of the improvements we've made:

* **No infrastructure VMs in Azure**: Data replicates directly to an Azure storage account. In addition, there's no need to set up any infrastructure VMs (like configuration server or master target server) for replication and failover as was needed in the legacy deployment.  
* **Unified installation**: A single installation provides simple setup and scalability for on-premises components.
* **Secure deployment**: All traffic is encrypted, and replication management communications are sent over HTTPS 443.
* **Recovery points**: Support for crash and application-consistent recovery points for Windows and Linux environments, and support for both single VM and multi-VM consistent configurations.
* **Test failover**: Support for non-disruptive test failover to Azure without affecting production or pausing replication.
* **Unplanned failover**: Support for unplanned failover to Azure with an enhanced option to automatically shut down VMs before failover.
* **Failback**: Integrated failback that replicates only delta changes back to the on-premises site.
* **vSphere 6.0**: Limited support for VMware vSphere 6.0 deployments.

## <a name="how-does-site-recovery-help-protect-virtual-machines-and-physical-servers"></a>How does Site Recovery help protect virtual machines and physical servers?
* VMware administrators can configure off-site safeguards to protect Azure from business workloads and applications running on VMware virtual machines. Server managers can replicate physical on-premises Windows and Linux servers to Azure.
* The Azure Site Recovery console provides a single location for simple setup and management of replication, failover, and recovery processes.
* If you replicate VMware virtual machines that are managed by a vCenter server, Site Recovery can discover those VMs automatically. If machines are on a ESXi host, Site Recovery discovers VMs on the host.
* If you run easy failovers from your on-premises infrastructure to Azure, you can fail back (restore) from Azure to VMware VM servers in the on-premises site.
* You can configure recovery plans that group application workloads that are tiered across multiple machines. If you fail over those plans, Site Recovery provides multi-VM consistency so that machines running the same workloads can be recovered together to a consistent data point.

## <a name="supported-operating-systems"></a>Supported operating systems
### <a name="windows-64-bit-only"></a>Windows (64 bit only)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1+
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2012 R2

### <a name="linux-64-bit-only"></a>Linux (64 bit only)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, 7.1, and 7.2
* CentOS 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2
* Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4 and 6.5 running either the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3)
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3

## <a name="scenario-architecture"></a>Scenario architecture
Scenario components:

* **An on-premises management server**: The management server runs Site Recovery components:
  * **Configuration server**:  Coordinates communication and manages data replication and recovery processes.
  * **Process server**:  Acts as a replication gateway. It receives data from protected source machines; optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption; and sends replication data to Azure storage. It also handles push installation of Mobility service to protected machines and performs automatic discovery of VMware VMs.
  * **Master target server**: Handles replication data during failback from Azure.
    You can also deploy a management server that acts only as a process server to scale your deployment.
* **The Mobility service**: This component is deployed on each machine (VMware VM or physical server) that you want to replicate to Azure. It captures data writes on the machine and forwards them to the process server.
* **Azure**: You don't need to create any Azure VMs to handle replication and failover. The Site Recovery service handles data management, and data replicates directly to Azure storage. Replicated Azure VMs are spun up automatically only when failover to Azure occurs. However, if you want to fail back from Azure to the on-premises site, you will need to set up an Azure VM to act as a process server.

The following graphic (created by Henry Robalino) shows how these components interact:

![Component architecture](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/v2a-architecture-henry.png)

## <a name="capacity-planning"></a>Capacity planning
When you’re planning capacity, here's what you need to think about:

* **The source environment**: Capacity planning or the VMware infrastructure and source machine requirements.
* **The management server**: Planning for the on-premises management servers that run Site Recovery components.
* **Network bandwidth from source to target**: Planning for network bandwidth required for replication between the source and Azure.

### <a name="source-environment-considerations"></a>Source environment considerations
* **Maximum daily change rate**: A protected machine can use only one process server. A single process server can handle up to 2 TB of data change per day. Thus, 2 TB is the maximum daily data change rate that’s supported for a protected machine.
* **Maximum throughput**: A replicated machine can belong to one storage account in Azure. A standard storage account can handle a maximum of 20,000 requests per second, and we recommend that you keep the number of IOPS across a source machine to 20,000. For example, if you have a source machine with 5 disks and each disk generates 120 IOPS (8 KB size) on the source, it will be within the Azure per disk IOPS limit of 500. The number of storage accounts required = total source IOPs/20,000.

### <a name="management-server-considerations"></a>Management server considerations
The management server runs Site Recovery components that handle data optimization, replication, and management. It should be able to handle the daily change rate capacity across all workloads running on protected machines, and it has sufficient bandwidth to continuously replicate data to Azure storage. Specifically:

* The process server receives replication data from protected machines and optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption before sending it to Azure. The management server should have sufficient resources to perform these tasks.
* The process server uses disk-based cache. We recommend a separate cache disk of 600 GB or more to handle data changes stored in the event of network bottleneck or outage. During deployment, you can configure the cache on any drive that has at least 5 GB of storage available, but 600 GB is the minimum recommendation.
* As a best practice, we recommend that the management server is located on the same network and LAN segment as the machines you want to protect. It can be located on a different network, but machines you want to protect should have L3 network visibility to it.

Size recommendations for the management server are summarized in the following table:

| **Management server CPU** | **Memory** | **Cache disk size** | **Data change rate** | **Protected machines** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 vCPUs (2 sockets * 4 cores @ 2.5 GHz) |16 GB |300 GB |500 GB or less |Deploy a management server with these settings to replicate fewer than 100 machines. |
| 12 vCPUs (2 sockets * 6 cores @ 2.5 GHz) |18 GB |600 GB |500 GB to 1 TB |Deploy a management server with these settings to replicate 100-150 machines. |
| 16 vCPUs (2 sockets * 8 cores @ 2.5 GHz) |32 GB |1 TB |1 TB to 2 TB |Deploy a management server with these settings to replicate 150-200 machines. |
| Deploy another process server | | |> 2 TB |Deploy additional process servers if you're replicating more than 200 machines, or if the daily data change rate exceeds 2 TB. |

Where:

* Each source machine is configured with 3 disks of 100 GB each.
* We used benchmarking storage of 8 SAS drives of 10,000 RPM with RAID 10 for cache disk measurements.

### <a name="network-bandwidth-from-source-to-target"></a>Network bandwidth from source to target
Make sure you calculate the bandwidth that would be required for initial replication and delta replication by using the [capacity planner tool](site-recovery-capacity-planner.md).

#### <a name="throttling-bandwidth-used-for-replication"></a>Throttling bandwidth used for replication
VMware traffic replicated to Azure goes through a specific process server. You can throttle the bandwidth that's available for Site Recovery replication on that server as follows:

1. Open the Microsoft Azure Backup MMC snap-in on the main management server or on a management server running additional provisioned process servers. By default, a shortcut for Microsoft Azure Backup is created on the desktop. Or, you can find it in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\bin\wabadmin.
2. In the snap-in, click **Change Properties**.

    ![Throttle bandwidth change properties](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/throttle1.png)
3. On the **Throttling** tab, specify the bandwidth that can be used for Site Recovery replication and the applicable scheduling.

    ![Throttle bandwidth replication](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/throttle2.png)

You can also set throttling by using PowerShell. Here's an example:

    Set-OBMachineSetting -WorkDay $mon, $tue -StartWorkHour "9:00:00" -EndWorkHour "18:00:00" -WorkHourBandwidth (512*1024) -NonWorkHourBandwidth (2048*1024)

#### <a name="maximizing-bandwidth-usage"></a>Maximizing bandwidth usage
To increase the bandwidth utilized for replication by Azure Site Recovery, you need to change a registry key.

The following key controls the number of threads per replicating disk that are used when replicating:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Azure Backup\Replication\UploadThreadsPerVM

 In an overprovisioned network, this registry key needs to be changed from its default values. We support a maximum of 32.  

For more about detailed capacity planning, see [Site Recovery capacity planner](site-recovery-capacity-planner.md).

### <a name="additional-process-servers"></a>Additional process servers
If you need to protect more than 200 machines or your daily change rate is greater that 2 TB, you can add additional servers to handle the load. To scale out, you can:

* Increase the number of management servers. For example, you can protect up to 400 machines with two management servers.
* Add additional process servers and use these to handle traffic instead of (or in addition to) the management server.

This table describes a scenario in which:

* You set up the original management server to use as a configuration server only.
* You set up an additional process server.
* You configure protected virtual machines to use the additional process server.
* Each protected source machine is configured with three disks of 100 GB each.

| **Original management server**<br/><br/>(configuration server) | **Additional process server** | **Cache disk size** | **Data change rate** | **Protected machines** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 vCPUs (2 sockets * 4 cores @ 2.5 GHz), 16 GB RAM |4 vCPUs (2 sockets * 2 cores @ 2.5 GHz), 8 GB RAM |300 GB |250 GB or less |You can replicate 85 or fewer machines. |
| 8 vCPUs (2 sockets * 4 cores @ 2.5 GHz), 16 GB RAM |8 vCPUs (2 sockets * 4 cores @ 2.5 GHz), 12 GB RAM |600 GB |250 GB to 1 TB |You can replicate 85-150 machines. |
| 12 vCPUs (2 sockets * 6 cores @ 2.5 GHz), 18 GB RAM |12 vCPUs (2 sockets * 6 cores @ 2.5 GHz) 24 GB RAM |1 TB |1 TB to 2 TB |You can replicate 150-225 machines. |

How you scale your servers depends on your preference for a scale-up or scale-out model. You scale up by deploying a few high-end management and process servers, or scale out by deploying more servers with fewer resources. For example: if you need to protect 220 machines, you can do either of the following:

* Configure the original management server with 12 vCPUs and 18 GB of RAM. Configure an additional process server with 12 vCPUs and 24 GB of RAM. Configure protected machines to use only the additional process server.
* Configure two management servers (2 x 8 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM) and two additional process servers (1 x 8 vCPUs and 4vCPUs x 1 to handle 135 + 85 (220) machines). Configure protected machines to use only the additional process servers.

Follow the instructions in [Deploy additional process servers](#deploy-additional-process-servers) to set up an additional process server.

## <a name="before-you-start-deployment"></a>Before you start deployment
The following tables summarize the prerequisites for deploying this scenario.

### <a name="azure-prerequisites"></a>Azure prerequisites
| **Prerequisite** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Azure account** |You need a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account. You can start with a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). For more information about Site Recovery pricing, see [Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/site-recovery/). |
| **Azure storage** |You need an Azure storage account to store replicated data. Replicated data is stored in Azure storage, and Azure VMs are spun up when failover occurs. <br/><br/>You need a [standard geo-redundant storage account](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage). The account must be in the same region as the Site Recovery service and be associated with the same subscription. Replication to premium storage accounts isn't currently supported and shouldn't be used.<br/><br/>We do not support moving storage accounts created by using the [Azure portal](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) across resource groups. For more information, see [Introduction to Microsoft Azure Storage](../storage/storage-introduction.md).<br/><br/> |
| **Azure network** |You need an Azure virtual network that Azure VMs will connect to when failover occurs. The Azure virtual network must be in the same region as the Site Recovery vault.<br/><br/>To fail back after failover to Azure, you need a VPN connection (or Azure ExpressRoute) set up from the Azure network to the on-premises site. |

### <a name="on-premises-prerequisites"></a>On-premises prerequisites
| **Prerequisite** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Management server** |You need an on-premises Windows 2012 R2 server running on a virtual machine or physical server. All of the on-premises Site Recovery components are installed on this management server.<br/><br/> We recommend you deploy the server as a highly available VMware VM. Failback to the on-premises site from Azure is always to VMware VMs regardless of whether you failed over VMs or physical servers. If you don't configure the management server as a VMware VM, you need to set up a separate master target server as a VMware VM to receive failback traffic.<br/><br/>The server should not be a domain controller.<br/><br/>The server should have a static IP address.<br/><br/>The host name of the server should be 15 characters or less.<br/><br/>The operating system locale should be English only.<br/><br/>The management server requires Internet access.<br/><br/>You need outbound access from the server as follows: Temporary access on HTTP 80 during setup of the Site Recovery components (to download MySQL); ongoing outbound access on HTTPS 443 for replication management; ongoing outbound access on HTTPS 9443 for replication traffic (this port can be modified).<br/><br/> Make sure these URLs are accessible from the management server: <br/>- \*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com<br/>- \*.accesscontrol.windows.net<br/>- \*.backup.windowsazure.com<br/>- \*.blob.core.windows.net<br/>- \*.store.core.windows.net<br/>- https://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt<br/>- [ https://dev.mysql.com/get/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi](https://dev.mysql.com/get/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi " https://dev.mysql.com/get/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi")<br/><br/>If you have IP address-based firewall rules on the server, check that the rules allow communication to Azure. You need to allow the [Azure Datacenter IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) and the HTTPS (443) port. You also need to whitelist IP address ranges for the Azure region of your subscription, and for West US. The URL [https://dev.mysql.com/get/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi](https://dev.mysql.com/get/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi " https://dev.mysql.com/get/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi") is for downloading MySQL. |
| **VMware vCenter/ESXi host** |You need one or more VMware vSphere ESX/ESXi hypervisors managing your VMware virtual machines, running ESX/ESXi version 6.0, 5.5, or 5.1 with the latest updates.<br/><br/> We recommend that you deploy a VMware vCenter server to manage your ESXi hosts. It should be running vCenter version 6.0 or 5.5 with the latest updates.<br/><br/>Note that Site Recovery doesn't support new vCenter and vSphere 6.0 features such as cross vCenter vMotion, virtual volumes, and storage DRS. Site Recovery support is limited to features that were also available in version 5.5. |
| **Protected machines** |**Azure**<br/><br/>Machines that you want to protect should conform with [Azure prerequisites](site-recovery-prereq.md) for creating Azure VMs.<br><br/>If you want to connect to the Azure VMs after failover, you need to enable Remote Desktop connections on the local firewall.<br/><br/>Individual disk capacity on protected machines shouldn’t be more than 1023 GB. A VM can have up to 64 disks (thus up to 64 TB). If you have disks larger than 1 TB, consider using database replication such as SQL Server Always On or Oracle Data Guard.<br/><br/>Minimum 2 GB of available space on the installation drive for component installation.<br/><br/>Shared disk guest clusters aren't supported. If you have a clustered deployment, consider using database replication such as SQL Server Always On or Oracle Data Guard.<br/><br/>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface(UEFI)/Extensible Firmware Interface(EFI) boot isn't supported.<br/><br/>Machine names should contain between 1 and 63 characters (letters, numbers, and hyphens). The name must start with a letter or number and end with a letter or number. After a machine is protected, you can modify the Azure name.<br/><br/>**VMware VMs**<br/><br>You need to install VMware vSphere PowerCLI  6.0. on the management server (configuration server).<br/><br/>VMware VMs you want to protect should have VMware tools installed and running.<br/><br/>If the source VM has NIC teaming, it’s converted to a single NIC after failover to Azure.<br/><br/>If protected VMs have an iSCSI disk, Site Recovery converts the protected VM iSCSI disk into a VHD file when the VM fails over to Azure. If iSCSI target can be reached by the Azure VM, it will connect to iSCSI target and essentially see two disks: the VHD disk on the Azure VM and the source iSCSI disk. In this case, you need to disconnect the iSCSI target that appears on the failed-over Azure VM.<br/><br/>For more information about the VMware user permissions that Site Recovery needs, see [VMware permissions for vCenter access](#vmware-permissions-for-vcenter-access).<br/><br/> **Windows Server machines (on VMware VM or physical server)**<br/><br/>The server should be running a supported 64-bit operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2 with at least SP1.<br/><br/>The operating system should be installed on drive C, and the OS disk should be a Windows basic disk. (The OS shouldn’t be installed on a Windows dynamic disk.)<br/><br/>For Windows Server 2008 R2 machines, you need to have .NET Framework 3.5.1 installed.<br/><br/>You need to provide an administrator account (must be a local administrator on the Windows machine) for the push installation the Mobility Service on Windows servers. If the provided account is a non-domain account, you need to disable Remote User Access control on the local machine. For more information, see [Install the mobility service with push installation](#install-the-mobility-service-with-push-installation).<br/><br/>Site Recovery supports VMs with an RDM disk. During failback, Site Recovery will reuse the RDM disk if the original source VM and RDM disk are available. If they aren’t available, during failback, Site Recovery will create a new VMDK file for each disk.<br/><br/>**Linux machines**<br/><br/>You need a supported 64-bit operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7; Centos 6.5, 6.6, or 6.7; Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4 or 6.5 running either the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3); SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3.<br/><br/>/etc/hosts files on protected machines should contain entries that map the local host name to IP addresses associated with all network adapters. <br/><br/>If you want to connect to an Azure virtual machine running Linux after failover by using a Secure Shell client (ssh), ensure that the Secure Shell service on the protected machine is set to start automatically on system boot, and that firewall rules allow an ssh connection to it.<br/><br/>Protection can only be enabled for Linux machines with the following storage: File system (EXT3, ETX4, ReiserFS, XFS); Multipath software-Device Mapper (multipath); Volume manager (LVM2). Physical servers with HP CCISS controller storage are not supported. The ReiserFS file system is supported only on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3.<br/><br/>Site Recovery supports VMs with an RDM disk. During failback for Linux, Site Recovery doesn’t reuse the RDM disk. Instead, it creates a new VMDK file for each corresponding RDM disk. |

Only for a Linux VM: ensure that you set the disk.enableUUID=true setting in the configuration parameters of the VM in VMware. If this row does not exist, add it. This is required to provide a consistent UUID to the VMDK so that it mounts correctly. Without this setting, failback will cause a full download even if the VM is available on-premises. Adding this setting ensures that only delta changes are transferred back during failback.

## <a name="step-6-set-up-credentials-for-the-vcenter-server"></a>Step 6: Set up credentials for the vCenter server
> [!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Azure/Enhanced-VMware-to-Azure-Discovery/player]
>
>

The process server can automatically discover VMware VMs that are managed by a vCenter server. For automatic discovery, Site Recovery needs an account and credentials that can access the vCenter server. This isn't relevant if you're replicating only physical servers.

To set the account and credentials:

1. On the vCenter server, create a role (**Azure_Site_Recovery**) at the vCenter level with the [required permissions](#vmware-permissions-for-vcenter-access).
2. Assign the **Azure_Site_Recovery** role to a vCenter user.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A vCenter user account that has the read-only role can run failover without shutting down protected source machines. If you want to shut down those machines, you'll need the Azure_Site_Recovery role. If you're only migrating VMs from VMware to Azure and don't need to fail back, the read-only role is sufficient.
   >
   >
3. To add the account, open **cspsconfigtool**. It's available as a shortcut on the desktop and located in the [INSTALL LOCATION]\home\svsystems\bin folder.
4. On the **Manage Accounts** tab, click **Add Account**.

    ![Add account](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/credentials1.png)
5. In **Account Details**, add credentials that can be used to access the vCenter server. It can take more than 15 minutes for the account name to appear in the portal. To update immediately, click **Refresh** on the **Configuration Servers** tab.

    ![Details](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/credentials2.png)

## <a name="step-7-add-vcenter-servers-and-esxi-hosts"></a>Step 7: Add vCenter servers and ESXi hosts
If you're replicating VMware VMs, you need to add a vCenter server (or ESXi host).

1. On the **Servers** > **Configuration Servers** tab, select **Add vCenter server**.

    ![vCenter](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/add-vcenter1.png)
2. Add the vCenter server or ESXi host details, the name of the account that you specified to access the vCenter server in the previous step, and the process server that will be used to discover VMware VMs that are managed by the vCenter server. The vCenter server or ESXi host should be located in the same network as the server on which the process server is installed.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're adding the vCenter server or ESXi host with an account that doesn't have administrator privileges on the vCenter or host server, make sure the vCenter or ESXi accounts have these privileges enabled: Datacenter, Datastore, Folder, Jost, Network, Resource, Virtual Machine, and vSphere Distributed Switch. The vCenter server needs the Storage Views privilege enabled.

## <a name="step-8-create-a-protection-group"></a>Step 8: Create a protection group
> [!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Azure/Enhanced-VMware-to-Azure-Protection/player]
>
>

Protection groups are logical groupings of virtual machines or physical servers that you want to protect by using the same protection settings. You apply protection settings to a protection group, and those settings are applied to all machines (virtual or physical) that you add to the group.

1. Go to **Protected Items** > **Protection Group** and click the icon to add a protection group.

    ![Create protection group](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/protection-groups1.png)
2. On the **Specify Protection Group Settings** page, specify a name for the group. In the **From** drop-down list, select the configuration server on which you want to create the group. **Target** is Microsoft Azure.

    ![Protection group settings](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/protection-groups2.png)
3. On the **Specify Replication Settings** page, configure the replication settings that will be used for all the machines in the group.

    ![Protection group replication](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/protection-groups3.png)

   * **Multi VM consistency**: If you turn this on, it creates shared application-consistent recovery points across the machines in the protection group. This setting is most relevant when all machines in the protection group are running the same workload. All machines will be recovered to the same data point. This is available whether you're replicating VMware VMs or physical servers (Windows or Linux).
   * **RPO threshold**: Sets the RPO. Alerts are generated when the continuous data protection replication exceeds the configured RPO threshold value.
   * **Recovery point retention**: Specifies the retention window. Protected machines can be recovered to any point within this window.
   * **Application-consistent snapshot frequency**: Specifies how frequently recovery points that contain application-consistent snapshots will be created.

When you select the check mark, a protection group is created with the name you specified. In addition, a second protection group is created with the name *protection-group-name*-Failback. This protection group is used if you fail back to the on-premises site after failover to Azure. You can monitor the protection groups as they're created on the **Protected Items** page.

## <a name="step-9-install-the-mobility-service"></a>Step 9: Install the Mobility service
The first step in enabling protection for virtual machines and physical servers is to install the Mobility service. You can do this in two ways:

* Automatically push and install the service on each machine from the process server. When you add machines to a protection group and they're already running an appropriate version of the Mobility service, push installation won't occur. You can also automatically install the service by using your enterprise push method, like WSUS or System Center Configuration Manager. Make sure you've set up the management server before you do this.
* Install the service manually on each machine that you want to protect. Make sure you've set up the management server before you do this.

### <a name="install-the-mobility-service-with-push-installation"></a>Install the Mobility service with push installation
When you add machines to a protection group, the Mobility service is automatically pushed and installed on each machine by the process server.

#### <a name="prepare-for-automatic-push-on-windows-machines"></a>Prepare for automatic push on Windows machines
To prepare Windows machines so that the Mobility service can be automatically installed by the process server:

1. Create an account that the process server can use to access the machine. The account should have administrator privileges (local or domain). These credentials are used only for push installation of the Mobility service.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're not using a domain account, you'll need to disable Remote User Access control on the local machine. To do this, in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System, add the DWORD entry LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy with a value of 1 under. To add the registry entry from a CLI open command or by using PowerShell, enter **`REG ADD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1`**.
   >
   >
2. For Windows Firewall on the machine that you want to protect, select **Allow an app or feature through Firewall**, and enable **File and Printer Sharing** and **Windows Management Instrumentation**. For machines that belong to a domain, you can configure the firewall policy with a GPO.

   ![Firewall settings](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/mobility1.png)
3. Add the account that you created:

   * Open **cspsconfigtool**. It's available as a shortcut on the desktop and located in the [INSTALL LOCATION]\home\svsystems\bin folder.
   * On the **Manage Accounts** tab, click **Add Account**.
   * Add the account that you created. After you add the account, you'll need to provide the credentials when you add a machine to a protection group.

#### <a name="prepare-for-automatic-push-on-linux-servers"></a>Prepare for automatic push on Linux servers
1. Make sure that the Linux machine you want to protect is supported as described in [On-premises prerequisites](#on-premises-prerequisites). Ensure that there’s network connectivity between the machine you want to protect and the management server that runs the process server.
2. Create an account that the process server can use to access the machine. The account should be a root user on the source Linux server. These credentials are used only for push installation of the Mobility service.

   * Open **cspsconfigtool**. It's available as a shortcut on the desktop and located in the [INSTALL LOCATION]\home\svsystems\bin folder.
   * On the **Manage Accounts** tab, click **Add Account**.
   * Add the account that you created. After you add the account, you'll need to provide the credentials when you add a machine to a protection group.
3. Check that the /etc/hosts file on the source Linux server contains entries that map the local hostname to IP addresses associated with all network adapters.
4. Install the latest openssh, openssh-server, and openssl packages on the machine that you want to protect.
5. Ensure that SSH is enabled and running on port 22.
6. Enable SFTP subsystem and password authentication in the sshd_config file as follows:

   * Sign in as root.
   * In the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, find the line that begins with PasswordAuthentication.
   * Uncomment the line and change the value from **no** to **yes**.
   * Find the line that begins with **Subsystem** and uncomment the line.

     ![Linux override default of no subsystems](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/mobility2.png)

    ./install -t both -a host -R MasterTarget -d /usr/local/ASR -i 104.40.75.37 -p 443 -s y -c https -P passphrase.txt


## <a name="step-10-enable-protection-for-a-machine"></a>Step 10: Enable protection for a machine
To enable protection, add virtual machines and physical servers to a protection group. Before you start, note the following if you're protecting VMware virtual machines:

* VMware VMs are discovered every 15 minutes, and it might take more than 15 minutes for them to appear in the Site Recovery portal after discovery.
* Environment changes on the virtual machine (such as VMware tools installation) might also take more than 15 minutes to be updated in Site Recovery.
* You can check the last discovered time for VMware VMs in the **Last Contact At** field for the vCenter server/ESXi host on the **Configuration Servers** tab.
* If you add a vCenter Server or ESXi host after creating a protection group, it might take more than 15 minutes for the Azure Site Recovery portal to refresh and for virtual machines to be listed in the **Add machines to a protection group** dialog box.
* If you want to proceed immediately and add machines to a protection group without waiting for the scheduled discovery, highlight the configuration server (don’t click it) and click **Refresh**.

In addition:

* We recommend that you architect your protection groups so that they mirror your workloads. For example, add machines that run a specific application to the same group.
* When you add machines to a protection group, the process server automatically pushes and installs the Mobility service if it isn't already installed. You'll need to have the push mechanism prepared as described in the previous step.

### <a name="add-machines-to-a-protection-group"></a>Add machines to a protection group

1. Go to **Protected Items** > **Protection Group** > **Machines** > **Add Machines**.
2. If you're protecting VMware virtual machines, in **Select Virtual Machines**, select a vCenter server that's managing your virtual machines (or the EXSi host on which they're running), and then select the machines.

    ![Enable protection for virtual machines](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/enable-protection2.png)
3. If you're protecting physical servers, in **Select Virtual Machines**, open the **Add Physical Machines** wizard and provide the IP address and friendly name. Then select the operating system family.

   ![Enable protection for physical servers](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/enable-protection1.png)
4. In **Specify Target Resources**, select the storage account that you're using for replication and select whether the settings should be used for all workloads. Premium storage accounts aren't currently supported.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We do not support moving storage accounts created by using the [Azure portal](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) across resource groups.

    ![Configure target settings](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/enable-protection3.png)
5. In **Specify Accounts**, select the account that you [set up](#install-the-mobility-service-with-push-installation) to use for automatic installation of the Mobility service.

    ![Specify accounts](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/enable-protection4.png)
6. Click the check mark to finish adding machines to the protection group and to start initial replication for each machine.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If push installation has been prepared, the Mobility service is automatically installed on machines that don't have it as they're added to the protection group. After the service is installed, a protection job starts and fails. After the failure, you'll need to manually restart each machine that's had the Mobility service installed. After the restart, the protection job begins again and initial replication occurs.
   >
   >

You can monitor status on the **Jobs** page.

![Monitor status on the Jobs page](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/enable-protection5.png)

Protection status can also be monitored in **Protected Items** > *protection group name* > **Virtual Machines**. After initial replication finishes and data is synchronized, machine status changes to **Protected**.

![Monitor status in Protected Items](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/enable-protection6.png)

## <a name="step-11-set-protected-machine-properties"></a>Step 11: Set protected machine properties
1. After a machine has a **Protected** status, you can configure its failover properties. In the protection group details, select the machine and open the **Configure** tab.
2. Site Recovery automatically suggests properties for the Azure VM and detects the on-premises network settings.

    ![Set virtual machine properties](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/vm-properties1.png)
3. You can change these settings:

   * **Azure VM name**: This is the name that will be given to the machine in Azure after failover. The name must comply with Azure requirements.
   * **Azure VM size**: The number of network adapters is dictated by the size that you specify for the target virtual machine. For more information about sizes and adapters, see the [size tables](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md). Note that:

     * When you modify the size of a virtual machine and save the settings, the number of network adapters will change when you open the **Configure** tab the next time. The minimum number of network adapters on target virtual machines is equal to the minimum number of network adapters on a source virtual machine. The maximum number of network adapters is determined by the size of the virtual machine.
       * If the number of network adapters on the source machine is less than or equal to the number of adapters allowed for the target machine size, the target will have the same number of adapters as the source.
       * If the number of adapters for the source virtual machine exceeds the number allowed for the target size, the target size maximum will be used.
        For example, if a source machine has two network adapters and the target machine size supports four, the target machine will have two adapters. If the source machine has two adapters but the supported target size supports only one, the target machine will have only one adapter.
     * If the virtual machine has multiple network adapters, all adapters should be connected to the same Azure network.
   * **Azure network**: You must specify an Azure network that Azure VMs will be connected to after failover. If you don't specify one, the Azure VMs won't be connected to any network. In addition, you need to specify an Azure network if you want to failback from Azure to the on-premises site. Failback requires a VPN connection between an Azure network and an on-premises network.
   * **Azure IP address/subnet**: For each network adapter, select the subnet to which the Azure VM should connect. Note that if the network adapter of the source machine is configured to use a static IP address, you can specify a static IP address for the Azure VM. If you don't provide a static IP address, then any available IP address will be allocated. If the target IP address is specified but it's already in use by another VM in Azure, failover will fail. If the network adapter of the source machine is configured to use DHCP, you'll have DHCP as the setting for Azure.      

## <a name="step-12-create-a-recovery-plan-and-run-a-failover"></a>Step 12: Create a recovery plan and run a failover
> [!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Azure/Enhanced-VMware-to-Azure-Failover/player]
>
>

You can run a failover for a single machine, or you can fail over multiple virtual machines that perform the same task or run the same workload. To fail over multiple machines at the same time, you add them to a recovery plan.

To create a recovery plan:

1. On the **Recovery Plans** page, click **Add Recovery Plan** and add a recovery plan. Specify details for the plan and select **Azure** as the target.

 ![Configure recovery plan](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/recovery-plan1.png)
2. In **Select Virtual Machine**, select a protection group, and then select machines in the group to add to the recovery plan.

 ![Add virtual machines](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/recovery-plan2.png)

You can customize the plan to create groups and sequence the order in which machines in the recovery plan are failed over. You can also add scripts and prompts for manual actions. Scripts can be created manually or by using [Azure Automation Runbooks](site-recovery-runbook-automation.md). For more information about customizing recovery plans, see [Create recovery plans](site-recovery-create-recovery-plans.md).

## <a name="run-a-failover"></a>Run a failover
Before you run a failover:

* Make sure that the management server is running and available. If it is not, failover will fail.
* If you run an unplanned failover:

  * If possible, you should shut down primary machines before you run an unplanned failover. This ensures that you don't have both the source and replica machines running at the same time. If you're replicating VMware VMs when you run an unplanned failover, you can specify that Site Recovery should try to shut down the source machines. Depending on the state of the primary site, this might or might not work. If you're replicating physical servers, Site Recovery doesn't offer this option.
  * An unplanned failover stops data replication from primary machines so that any data delta won't be transferred after an unplanned failover begins.
  * If you want to connect to the replica virtual machine in Azure after failover, enable Remote Desktop Connection on the source machine before you run the failover. Then allow RDP connection through the firewall. You'll also need to allow RDP on the public endpoint of the Azure virtual machine after failover. Follow [best practices](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx) to ensure that RDP works after a failover.

> [!NOTE]
> To get the best performance when you do a failover to Azure, ensure that you have installed the Azure Agent on the protected machine. This helps the machine boot faster and helps diagnose issues. The Azure Agent is available for [Linux](https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent) and [Windows](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789).

### <a name="run-a-test-failover"></a>Run a test failover
Run a test failover to simulate your failover and recovery processes in an isolated network that doesn't affect your production environment and lets regular replication continue as normal. Test failover is initiatd on the source, and you can run it in a couple of ways:

* **Don't specify an Azure network**: If you run a test failover without a network, the test will check that virtual machines start and appear correctly in Azure. Virtual machines won’t be connected to an Azure network after failover.
* **Specify an Azure network**: This type of failover checks that the entire replication environment comes up as expected and that Azure virtual machines are connected to the specified network.

To run a test failover:

1. On the **Recovery Plans** page, select the plan and click **Test Failover**.

 ![Select the plan](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/test-failover1.png)
2. In **Confirm Test Failover**, select **None** to indicate that you don't want to use an Azure network for the test failover, or select the network to which the test VMs will be connected after failover. Click the check mark to start the failover.

 ![Make a selection](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/test-failover2.png)
3. Monitor failover progress on the **Jobs** tab.

 ![Monitor progress](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/test-failover3.png)
4. After the failover finishes, you should also be able to see the replica Azure machine appear in **Virtual Machines** in the Azure portal. If you want to initiate an RDP connection to the Azure VM, you’ll need to open port 3389 on the VM endpoint.
5. After you’ve finished, when failover reaches the **Complete** testing phase, click **Complete Test** to finish. In **Notes**, record and save any observations associated with the test failover.
6. Click **The test failover is complete** to automatically clean up the test environment. After this is done, the test failover will show a **Complete** status. Any elements or VMs created automatically during the test failover are deleted. If a test failover continues longer than two weeks, it’s forced to finish.

### <a name="run-an-unplanned-failover"></a>Run an unplanned failover
Unplanned failover is initiated from Azure and can be performed even if the primary site isn't available.

1. On the **Recovery Plans** page, select the plan and click **Failover** > **Unplanned Failover**.

 ![Select the plan](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/unplanned-failover1.png)
2. If you're replicating VMware virtual machines, you can try to shut down on-premises VMs. This is a best-effort action, and failover continues whether the effort succeeds or not. If it doesn't succeed, error details will appear on the **Jobs** tab under **Unplanned Failover Jobs**.

 ![Option for shutting down on-premises VMs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/unplanned-failover2.png)

 > [!NOTE]
 > This option isn't available if you're replicating physical servers. You'll need to try to shut those down manually if possible.
 >

3. In **Confirm Failover**, verify the failover direction (to Azure) and select the recovery point that you want to use for the failover. If you enabled multi-VM when you configured replication properties, you can recover to the latest application or crash-consistent recovery point. You can also select **Custom recovery point** to recover to an earlier point in time. Click the check mark to start the failover.

 ![Confirm failover direction](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/unplanned-failover3.png)
4. Wait for the unplanned failover job to finish. You can monitor failover progress on the **Jobs** tab. Even if errors occur during unplanned failover, the recovery plan runs until it's complete. You should also be able to see the replica Azure machine appear in **Virtual Machines** in the Azure portal.

### <a name="connect-to-replicated-azure-virtual-machines-after-failover"></a>Connect to replicated Azure virtual machines after failover
To connect to replicated virtual machines in Azure after failover, you need:

- A Remote Desktop connection enabled on the primary machine.
- Windows Firewall on the primary machine set to allow RDP.
- RDP added to the public endpoint for the Azure virtual machine.

For more about setting this up, see [Troubleshooting remote desktop connection after failover using ASR](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).

## <a name="deploy-additional-process-servers"></a>Deploy additional process servers
If you must scale out your deployment beyond 200 source machines, or if your total daily churn rate exceeds 2 TB, you’ll need additional process servers to handle the traffic volume. To set up an additional process server, check the requirements in [Additional process servers](#additional-process-servers), and then set up the process server according to the following instructions. After you set up the server, you can configure source machines to use it.

### <a name="set-up-an-additional-process-server"></a>Set up an additional process server
Set up an additional process server as follows:

* Run the unified wizard to configure a management server as a process server only.
* If you want to manage data replication by using only the new process server, you need to migrate your protected machines.

### <a name="install-the-process-server"></a>Install the process server
1. On the **Quick Start** page, download the unified installation file for the Site Recovery component installation. Run Setup.
2. In **Before you begin**, select **Add additional process servers to scale out deployment**.

 ![Add process server](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/add-ps1.png)
3. Complete the wizard as you did when you [set up](#step-5-install-the-management-server) the first management server.
4. In **Configuration Server Details**, enter the IP address of the original management server on which you installed the configuration server, and then enter the passphrase. If you do not have the passphrase, run **<SiteRecoveryInstallationFolder>\home\sysystems\bin\genpassphrase.exe –n** on the original management server to retrieve it.

 ![Configuration server details](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/add-ps2.png)

### <a name="migrate-machines-to-use-the-new-process-server"></a>Migrate machines to use the new process server
1. Open **Configuration Servers** > **Server** > *name of the original management server* > **Server Details**.

 ![Server details](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/update-process-server1.png)
2. In the **Process Servers** list, select **Change Process Server** next to the server that you want to change.

 ![Update the process server](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/site-recovery/media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic/update-process-server2.png)
3. Select **Change Process Server**, select **Target Process Server**, and then select the new management server. Then select the virtual machines that the new process server will handle. Click the information icon to get information about the server. The average space that's needed to replicate each selected virtual machine to the new process server is displayed to help you make load decisions. Click the check mark to start replicating to the new process server.

## <a name="vmware-permissions-for-vcenter-access"></a>VMware permissions for vCenter access
The process server can automatically discover VMs on a vCenter server. To perform automatic discovery, you need to define a role (Azure_Site_Recovery) at the vCenter level to allow Site Recovery to access the vCenter server. If you only need to migrate VMware machines to Azure and don't need to failback from Azure, you can define a read-only role that's sufficient. Set up the permissions as described in [Step 6: Set up credentials for the vCenter server](#step-6-set-up-credentials-for-the-vcenter-server). The role permissions are summarized in the following table:

| **Role** | **Details** | **Permissions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure_Site_Recovery role |VMware VM discovery |Assign these privileges for the v-Center server:<br/><br/>Datastore: Allocate space, Browse datastore, Low-level file operations, Remove file, Update virtual machine files<br/><br/>Network: Network assign<br/><br/>Resource: Assign virtual machine to resource pool, Migrate powered-off virtual machine, Migrate powered-on virtual machine<br/><br/>Tasks: Create task, Update task<br/><br/>Virtual machine >  Configuration<br/><br/>Virtual machine > Interact > Answer question, Device connection, Configure CD media, Configure floppy media, Power off, Power on, VMware tools install<br/><br/>Virtual machine > Inventory > Create, Register, Unregister<br/><br/>Virtual machine > Provisioning > Allow virtual machine download, Allow virtual machine files upload<br/><br/>Virtual machine > Snapshots > Remove snapshots |
| vCenter user role |VMware VM discovery/Failover without shutdown of source VM |Assign these privileges for the v-Center server:<br/><br/>Data Center object > Propagate to Child Object, role=Read-only <br/><br/>The user is assigned at the datacenter level and thus has access to all the objects in the datacenter. If you want to restrict the access, assign the **No access** role with the **Propagate to child** object to the child objects (ESX hosts, datastores, VMs, and networks). |
| vCenter user role |Failover and failback |Assign these privileges for the v-Center server:<br/><br/>Datacenter object – Propagate to child object, role=Azure_Site_Recovery<br/><br/>The user is assigned at datacenter level and thus has access to all the objects in the datacenter.  If you want to restrict the access, assign the **No access **role with the **Propagate to child object** to the child object (ESX hosts, datastores, VMs, and networks). |
