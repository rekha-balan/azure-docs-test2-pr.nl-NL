### <a name="azure-site-recovery-scout-801-update-3"></a>Azure Site Recovery Scout 8.0.1 Update 3
Update 3 includes the following bug fixes and enhancements:

* The configuration server and RX fail to register to the Site Recovery vault when they're behind the proxy.
* The number of hours that the recovery point objective (RPO) is not met is not getting updated in the health report.
* The configuration server is not syncing with RX when the ESX hardware details or network details contain any UTF-8 characters.
* Windows Server 2008 R2 domain controllers fail to boot after recovery.
* Offline sync is not working as expected.
* After virtual machine (VM) failover, replication-pair deletion gets stuck in the CX UI for a long time, and users cannot complete the failback or resume operation.
* Overall snapshot operations that are done by the consistency job have been optimized to help reduce application disconnects like SQL clients.
* The performance of the consistency tool (VACP.exe) has been improved by reducing the memory usage that is required for creating snapshots on Windows.
* The push install service crashes when the password is greater than 16 characters.
* vContinuum is not checking and prompting for new vCenter credentials when the credentials are changed.
* On Linux, the master target cache manager (cachemgr) is not downloading files from the process server, which results in replication pair throttling.
* When the physical failover cluster (MSCS) disk order is not the same on all the nodes, replication is not set for some of the cluster volumes.
  <br/>Note that the cluster needs to be reprotected to take advantage of this fix.  
* SMTP functionality is not working as expected after RX is upgraded from Scout 7.1 to Scout 8.0.1.
* More stats have been added in the log for the rollback operation to track the time it has taken to complete it.
* Support has been added for Linux operating systems on the source server:
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 update 7
  * CentOS 6 update 7
* The CX and RX UI can now show the notification for the pair, which goes into bitmap mode.
* The following security fixes have been added in RX:

| **Issue description** | **Implementation procedures** |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization bypass via parameter tampering |Restricted access to non-applicable users. |
| Cross-site request forgery |Implemented the page-token concept, which generates randomly for every page. <br/>With this, you will see: <li> There is only a single sign-in instance for the same user.</li><li>Page refresh does not work--it will redirect to the dashboard.</li> |
| Malicious file upload |Restricted files to certain extensions. Allowed extensions are: 7z, aiff, asf, avi, bmp, csv, doc, docx, fla, flv, gif, gz, gzip, jpeg, jpg, log, mid, mov, mp3, mp4, mpc, mpeg, mpg, ods, odt, pdf, png, ppt, pptx, pxd, qt, ram, rar, rm, rmi, rmvb, rtf, sdc, sitd, swf, sxc, sxw, tar, tgz, tif, tiff, txt, vsd, wav, wma, wmv, xls, xlsx, xml, and zip. |
| Persistent cross-site scripting |Added input validations. |

> [!NOTE]
> * All Site Recovery updates are cumulative. Update 3 has all the fixes of Update 1 and Update 2. Update 3 can be directly applied on 8.0.1 GA.
> * The configuration server and RX updates canâ€™t be rolled back after they're applied on the system.

### <a name="azure-site-recovery-scout-801-update-2-update-03dec15"></a>Azure Site Recovery Scout 8.0.1 Update 2 (Update 03Dec15)
Fixes in Update 2 include:

* **Configuration server**: Fix for an issue that prevented the 31-day free metering feature from working as expected when the configuration server was registered in Site Recovery.
* **Unified agent**: Fix for an issue in Update 1 that resulted in the update not being installed on the master target server when it was upgraded from version 8.0 to 8.0.1.

### <a name="azure-site-recovery-scout-801-update-1"></a>Azure Site Recovery Scout 8.0.1 Update 1
Update 1 includes the following bug fixes and new features:

* 31 days of free protection per server instance. This enables you to test functionality or set up a proof-of-concept.
  * All operations on the server, including failover and failback, are free for the first 31 days, starting from the time that a server is first protected with Site Recovery Scout.
  * From the 32nd day onwards, each protected server will be charged at the standard instance rate for Azure Site Recovery protection to a customer-owned site.
  * At any time, the number of protected servers that are currently being charged is available on the Dashboard page of the Azure Site Recovery vault.
* Support added for vSphere Command-Line Interface (vCLI) 5.5 Update 2.
* Support added for Linux operating systems on the source server:
  * RHEL 6 Update 6
  * RHEL 5 Update 11
  * CentOS 6 Update 6
  * CentOS 5 Update 11
* Bug fixes to address the following issues:
  * Vault registration fails for the configuration server or RX server.
  * Cluster volumes don't appear as expected when clustered virtual machines are reprotected when they resume.
  * Failback fails when the master target server is hosted on a different ESXi server from the on-premises production virtual machines.
  * Configuration file permissions are changed when you upgrade to 8.0.1, which affects protection and operations.
  * The resynchronization threshold isn't enforced as expected, which leads to inconsistent replication behavior.
  * The RPO settings are not appearing correctly in the configuration server interface. The uncompressed data value incorrectly shows the compressed value.
  * The Remove operation doesn't delete as expected in the vContinuum wizard, and replication isn't deleted from the configuration server interface.
  * In the vContinuum wizard, the disk is automatically unselected when you click **Details** in the disk view during protection of MSCS virtual machines.
  * During the physical-to-virtual (P2V) scenario, required HP services, such as CIMnotify and CqMgHost, aren't moved to manual in virtual machine recovery. This results in additional boot time.
  * Linux virtual machine protection fails when there are more than 26 disks on the master target server.
