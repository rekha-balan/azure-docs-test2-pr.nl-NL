# <a name="about-azure-devtest-labs"></a>About Azure DevTest Labs
## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
Developers and testers are looking to solve the delays in creating and managing their environments by going to the cloud.  Azure solves the problem of environment delays and allows self-service within a new cost efficient structure.  However, developers and testers still need to spend considerable time configuring their self-served environments. Also, decision makers are uncertain about how to leverage the cloud to maximize their cost savings without adding too much process overhead.

Azure DevTest Labs is a service that helps developers and testers quickly create environments in Azure while minimizing waste and controlling cost. You can test the latest version of your application by quickly provisioning Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and artifacts. Easily integrate your deployment pipeline with DevTest Labs to provision on-demand environments. Scale up your load testing by provisioning multiple test agents, and create pre-provisioned environments for training and demos.

DevTest Labs provides the following benefits in creating, configuring, and managing developer and test environments in the cloud

## <a name="worry-free-self-service"></a>Worry-free self-service
DevTest Labs makes it easier to control costs by allowing you to set policies on your lab - such as number of virtual machines (VM) per user and number of VMs per lab. DevTest Labs also enables you to create policies to automatically shut down and start VMs.

## <a name="quickly-get-to-ready-to-test"></a>Quickly get to ready-to-test
DevTest Labs enables you to create pre-provisioned environments with everything your team needs to start developing and testing applications. Simply claim the environments where the last good build of your application is installed and get working right away. Or, use containers for even faster and leaner environment creation.

## <a name="create-once-use-everywhere"></a>Create once, use everywhere
Capture and share environment templates and artifacts within your team or organization - all in source control - to create developer and test environments easily.

## <a name="integrates-with-your-existing-toolchain"></a>Integrates with your existing toolchain
Leverage pre-made plug-ins or our API to provision Dev/Test environments directly from your preferred continuous integration (CI) tool, integrated development environment (IDE), or automated release pipeline. You can also use our comprehensive command-line tool.
