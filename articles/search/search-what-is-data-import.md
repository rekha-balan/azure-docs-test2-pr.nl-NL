> [!TIP]
> Numerous [Azure Search code samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=search) include embedded or readily available datasets, offering an easy way to get started. The portal also provides a sample indexer and data source consisting of a small real estate dataset (named "realestate-us-sample"). When you run the preconfigured indexer on the sample data source, an index is created and loaded with documents that can then be queried in Search explorer or by code that you write.
