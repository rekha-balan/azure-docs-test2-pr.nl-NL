# <a name="connecting-azure-sql-database-to-azure-search-using-indexers"></a>Connecting Azure SQL Database to Azure Search using indexers
Azure Search service is a hosted cloud search service that makes it easy to provide a great search experience. Before you can search, you need to populate an Azure Search index with your data. If the data lives in an Azure SQL database, the new **Azure Search indexer for Azure SQL Database** (or **Azure SQL indexer** for short) can automate the indexing process. This means you have less code to write and less infrastructure to care about.

This article covers the mechanics of using indexers, but it also describes the features that are only available with Azure SQL databases (for example, integrated change tracking). Azure Search also supports other data sources, such as Azure DocumentDB, blob storage, and table storage. If you would like to see support for additional data sources, provide your feedback on the [Azure Search feedback forum](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search/).

## <a name="indexers-and-data-sources"></a>Indexers and data sources
You can set up and configure an Azure SQL indexer using:

* Import Data wizard in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
* Azure Search [.NET SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn951165.aspx)
* Azure Search [REST API](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=528173)

In this article, we'll use the REST API to show you how to create and manage **indexers** and **data sources**.

A **data source** specifies which data to index, credentials needed to access the data, and policies that efficiently identify changes in the data (new, modified, or deleted rows). It's defined as an independent resource so that it can be used by multiple indexers.

An **indexer** is a resource that connects data sources with target search indexes. An indexer is used in the following ways:

* Perform a one-time copy of the data to populate an index.
* Update an index with changes in the data source on a schedule.
* Run on-demand to update an index as needed.

## <a name="when-to-use-azure-sql-indexer"></a>When to Use Azure SQL Indexer
Depending on several factors relating to your data, the use of Azure SQL indexer may or may not be appropriate. If your data fits the following requirements, you can use Azure SQL indexer:

* All the data comes from a single table or view
  * If the data is scattered across multiple tables, you can create a view and use that view with the indexer. However, if you use a view, you won’t be able to use SQL Server integrated change detection. For more information, see [this section](#CaptureChangedRows).
* The data types used in the data source are supported by the indexer. Most but not all the SQL types are supported. For details, see [Mapping data types in Azure Search](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=528105).
* You don’t need near real-time updates to the index when a row changes.
  * The indexer can re-index your table at most every 5 minutes. If your data changes frequently and the changes need to be reflected in the index within seconds or single minutes, we recommend using [Azure Search Index API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798930.aspx) directly.
* If you have a large data set and plan to run the indexer on a schedule, your schema allows us to efficiently identify changed (and deleted, if applicable) rows. For more details, see "Capturing Changed and Deleted Rows" below.
* The size of the indexed fields in a row doesn’t exceed the maximum size of an Azure Search indexing request, which is 16 MB.

## <a name="create-and-use-an-azure-sql-indexer"></a>Create and Use an Azure SQL Indexer
First, create the data source:

    POST https://myservice.search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=2016-09-01
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: admin-key

    {
        "name" : "myazuresqldatasource",
        "type" : "azuresql",
        "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "Server=tcp:<your server>.database.windows.net,1433;Database=<your database>;User ID=<your user name>;Password=<your password>;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30;" },
        "container" : { "name" : "name of the table or view that you want to index" }
    }


You can get the connection string from the [Azure Classic Portal](https://portal.azure.com); use the `ADO.NET connection string` option.

Then, create the target Azure Search index if you don’t have one already. You can create an index using the [portal UI](https://portal.azure.com) or the [Create Index API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798941.aspx). Ensure that the schema of your target index is compatible with the schema of the source table - see [mapping between SQL and Azure search data types](#TypeMapping).

Finally, create the indexer by giving it a name and referencing the data source and target index:

    POST https://myservice.search.windows.net/indexers?api-version=2016-09-01
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: admin-key

    {
        "name" : "myindexer",
        "dataSourceName" : "myazuresqldatasource",
        "targetIndexName" : "target index name"
    }

An indexer created in this way doesn’t have a schedule. It automatically runs once when it’s created. You can run it again at any time using a **run indexer** request:

    POST https://myservice.search.windows.net/indexers/myindexer/run?api-version=2016-09-01
    api-key: admin-key

You can customize several aspects of indexer behavior, such as batch size and how many documents can be skipped before an indexer execution fails. For more information, see [Create Indexer API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn946899.aspx).

You may need to allow Azure services to connect to your database. See [Connecting From Azure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee621782.aspx#ConnectingFromAzure) for instructions on how to do that.

To monitor the indexer status and execution history (number of items indexed, failures, etc.), use an **indexer status** request:

    GET https://myservice.search.windows.net/indexers/myindexer/status?api-version=2016-09-01
    api-key: admin-key

The response should look similar to the following:

    {
        "@odata.context":"https://myservice.search.windows.net/$metadata#Microsoft.Azure.Search.V2015_02_28.IndexerExecutionInfo",
        "status":"running",
        "lastResult": {
            "status":"success",
            "errorMessage":null,
            "startTime":"2015-02-21T00:23:24.957Z",
            "endTime":"2015-02-21T00:36:47.752Z",
            "errors":[],
            "itemsProcessed":1599501,
            "itemsFailed":0,
            "initialTrackingState":null,
            "finalTrackingState":null
        },
        "executionHistory":
        [
            {
                "status":"success",
                "errorMessage":null,
                "startTime":"2015-02-21T00:23:24.957Z",
                "endTime":"2015-02-21T00:36:47.752Z",
                "errors":[],
                "itemsProcessed":1599501,
                "itemsFailed":0,
                "initialTrackingState":null,
                "finalTrackingState":null
            },
            ... earlier history items
        ]
    }

Execution history contains up to 50 of the most recently completed executions, which are sorted in the reverse chronological order (so that the latest execution comes first in the response).
Additional information about the response can be found in [Get Indexer Status](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528198)

## <a name="run-indexers-on-a-schedule"></a>Run indexers on a schedule
You can also arrange the indexer to run periodically on a schedule. To do this, add the **schedule** property when creating or updating the indexer. The example below shows a PUT request to update the indexer:

    PUT https://myservice.search.windows.net/indexers/myindexer?api-version=2016-09-01
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: admin-key

    {
        "dataSourceName" : "myazuresqldatasource",
        "targetIndexName" : "target index name",
        "schedule" : { "interval" : "PT10M", "startTime" : "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
    }

The **interval** parameter is required. The interval refers to the time between the start of two consecutive indexer executions. The smallest allowed interval is 5 minutes; the longest is one day. It must be formatted as an XSD "dayTimeDuration" value (a restricted subset of an [ISO 8601 duration](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dayTimeDuration) value). The pattern for this is: `P(nD)(T(nH)(nM))`. Examples: `PT15M` for every 15 minutes, `PT2H` for every 2 hours.

The optional **startTime** indicates when the scheduled executions should commence. If it is omitted, the current UTC time is used. This time can be in the past – in which case the first execution is scheduled as if the indexer has been running continuously since the startTime.  

Only one execution of an indexer can run at a time. If an indexer is running when its execution is scheduled, the execution is postponed until the next scheduled time.

Let’s consider an example to make this more concrete. Suppose we the following hourly schedule configured:

    "schedule" : { "interval" : "PT1H", "startTime" : "2015-03-01T00:00:00Z" }

Here’s what happens:

1. The first indexer execution starts at or around March 1, 2015 12:00 a.m. UTC.
2. Assume this execution takes 20 minutes (or any time less than 1 hour).
3. The second execution starts at or around March 1, 2015 1:00 a.m.
4. Now suppose that this execution takes more than an hour – for example, 70 minutes – so that it completes around 2:10 a.m.
5. It’s now 2:00 a.m., time for the third execution to start. However, because the second execution from 1 a.m. is still running, the third execution is skipped. The third execution starts at 3 a.m.

You can add, change, or delete a schedule for an existing indexer by using a **PUT indexer** request.

<a name="CaptureChangedRows"></a>

## <a name="capturing-new-changed-and-deleted-rows"></a>Capturing new, changed, and deleted rows
If your table has many rows, you should use a data change detection policy. Change detection enables an efficient retrieval of only the new or changed rows without having to re-index the entire table.

### <a name="sql-integrated-change-tracking-policy"></a>SQL Integrated Change Tracking Policy
If your SQL database supports [change tracking](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb933875.aspx), we recommend using **SQL Integrated Change Tracking Policy**. This is the most efficient policy. In addition, it allows Azure Search to identify deleted rows without you having to add an explicit "soft delete" column to your table.

Integrated change tracking is supported starting with the following SQL Server database versions:

* SQL Server 2008 R2 and later, if you're using SQL Server on Azure VMs.
* Azure SQL Database V12, if you're using Azure SQL Database.

When using SQL integrated change tracking policy, do not specify a separate data deletion detection policy - this policy has built-in support for identifying deleted rows.

This policy can only be used with tables; it cannot be used with views. You need to enable change tracking for the table you're using before you can use this policy. See [Enable and disable change tracking](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb964713.aspx) for instructions.

To use this policy, create or update your data source like this:

    {
        "name" : "myazuresqldatasource",
        "type" : "azuresql",
        "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "connection string" },
        "container" : { "name" : "table or view name" },
        "dataChangeDetectionPolicy" : {
           "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.SqlIntegratedChangeTrackingPolicy"
      }
    }

<a name="HighWaterMarkPolicy"></a>

### <a name="high-water-mark-change-detection-policy"></a>High Water Mark Change Detection policy
While the SQL Integrated Change Tracking policy is recommended, it can only be used with tables, not views. If you're using a view, consider using the high water mark policy. This policy can be used if your table or view contains a column that meets the following criteria:

* All inserts specify a value for the column.
* All updates to an item also change the value of the column.
* The value of this column increases with each insert or update.
* Queries with the following WHERE and ORDER BY clauses can be executed efficiently: `WHERE [High Water Mark Column] > [Current High Water Mark Value] ORDER BY [High Water Mark Column]`.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> We strongly recommend using a **rowversion** column for change tracking. If any other data type is used, change tracking is not guaranteed to capture all changes in the presence of transactions executing concurrently with an indexer query.

To use a high water mark policy, create or update your data source like this:

    {
        "name" : "myazuresqldatasource",
        "type" : "azuresql",
        "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "connection string" },
        "container" : { "name" : "table or view name" },
        "dataChangeDetectionPolicy" : {
           "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.HighWaterMarkChangeDetectionPolicy",
           "highWaterMarkColumnName" : "[a rowversion or last_updated column name]"
      }
    }

> [!WARNING]
> If the source table does not have an index on the high water mark column, queries used by the SQL indexer may time out. In particular, the `ORDER BY [High Water Mark Column]` clause requires an index to run efficiently when the table contains many rows.
>
>

If you encounter timeout errors, you can use the `queryTimeout` indexer configuration setting to set the query timeout to a value higher than the default 5-minute timeout. For example, to set the timeout to 10 minutes, create or update the indexer with the following configuration:

    {
      ... other indexer definition properties
     "parameters" : {
            "configuration" : { "queryTimeout" : "00:10:00" } }
    }

You can also disable the `ORDER BY [High Water Mark Column]` clause. However, this is not recommended because if the indexer execution is interrupted by an error, the indexer has to re-process all rows if it runs later - even if the indexer has already processed almost all the rows by the time it was interrupted. To disable the `ORDER BY` clause, use the `disableOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn` setting in the indexer definition:  

    {
     ... other indexer definition properties
     "parameters" : {
            "configuration" : { "disableOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn" : true } }
    }

### <a name="soft-delete-column-deletion-detection-policy"></a>Soft Delete Column Deletion Detection policy
When rows are deleted from the source table, you probably want to delete those rows from the search index as well. If you use the SQL integrated change tracking policy, this is taken care of for you. However, the high water mark change tracking policy doesn’t help you with deleted rows. What to do?

If the rows are physically removed from the table, Azure Search has no way to infer the presence of records that no longer exist.  However, you can use the “soft-delete” technique to logically delete rows without removing them from the table. Add a column to your table or view and mark rows as deleted using that column.

When using the soft-delete technique, you can specify the soft delete policy as follows when creating or updating the data source:

    {
        …,
        "dataDeletionDetectionPolicy" : {
           "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.SoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy",
           "softDeleteColumnName" : "[a column name]",
           "softDeleteMarkerValue" : "[the value that indicates that a row is deleted]"
        }
    }

The **softDeleteMarkerValue** must be a string – use the string representation of your actual value. For example, if you have an integer column where deleted rows are marked with the value 1, use `"1"`. If you have a BIT column where deleted rows are marked with the Boolean true value, use `"True"`.

## <a name="mapping-between-sql-data-types-and-azure-search-data-types"></a>Mapping between SQL Data Types and Azure Search data types
| SQL data type | Allowed target index field types | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bit |Edm.Boolean, Edm.String | |
| int, smallint, tinyint |Edm.Int32, Edm.Int64, Edm.String | |
| bigint |Edm.Int64, Edm.String | |
| real, float |Edm.Double, Edm.String | |
| smallmoney, money decimal numeric |Edm.String |Azure Search does not support converting decimal types into Edm.Double because this would lose precision |
| char, nchar, varchar, nvarchar |Edm.String<br/>Collection(Edm.String) |A SQL string can be used to populate a Collection(Edm.String) field if the string represents a JSON array of strings: `["red", "white", "blue"]` |
| smalldatetime, datetime, datetime2, date, datetimeoffset |Edm.DateTimeOffset, Edm.String | |

| geography |Edm.GeographyPoint |Only geography instances of type POINT with SRID 4326 (which is the default) are supported |
| rowversion |N/A |Row-version columns cannot be stored in the search index, but they can be used for change tracking |
| time, timespan, binary, varbinary, image, xml, geometry, CLR types |N/A |Not supported |

## <a name="configuration-settings"></a>Configuration Settings
SQL indexer exposes several configuration settings:

| Setting | Data type | Purpose | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| queryTimeout |string |Sets the timeout for SQL query execution |5 minutes ("00:05:00") |
| disableOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn |bool |Causes the SQL query used by the high water mark policy to omit the ORDER BY clause. See [High Water Mark policy](#HighWaterMarkPolicy) |false |

These settings are used in the `parameters.configuration` object in the indexer definition. For example, to set the query timeout to 10 minutes, create or update the indexer with the following configuration:

    {
      ... other indexer definition properties
     "parameters" : {
            "configuration" : { "queryTimeout" : "00:10:00" } }
    }

## <a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>Frequently asked questions
**Q:** Can I use Azure SQL indexer with SQL databases running on IaaS VMs in Azure?

A: Yes. However, you need to allow your search service to connect to your database. For more information, see [Configure a connection from an Azure Search indexer to SQL Server on an Azure VM](search-howto-connecting-azure-sql-iaas-to-azure-search-using-indexers.md).

**Q:** Can I use Azure SQL indexer with SQL databases running on-premises?

A: We do not recommend or support this, as doing this would require you to open your databases to Internet traffic.

**Q:** Can I use Azure SQL indexer with databases other than SQL Server running in IaaS on Azure?

A: We don’t support this scenario, because we haven’t tested the indexer with any databases other than SQL Server.  

**Q:** Can I create multiple indexers running on a schedule?

A: Yes. However, only one indexer can be running on one node at one time. If you need multiple indexers running concurrently, consider scaling up your search service to more than one search unit.

**Q:** Does running an indexer affect my query workload?

A: Yes. Indexer runs on one of the nodes in your search service, and that node’s resources are shared between indexing and serving query traffic and other API requests. If you run intensive indexing and query workloads and encounter a high rate of 503 errors or increasing response times, consider scaling up your search service.
