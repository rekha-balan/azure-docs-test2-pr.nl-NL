# <a name="use-time-series-insights-to-visualize-telemetry-sent-from-the-device-simulation-solution-accelerator"></a>Use Time Series Insights to visualize telemetry sent from the Device Simulation solution accelerator

The Device Simulation solution accelerator lets you generate telemetry from simulated devices to test your IoT solutions. This how-to guide shows you how to visualize and analyze the simulated telemetry using a Time Series Insights environment.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this how-to guide, you need an active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

The steps in this how-to guide assume you've deployed the Device Simulation solution accelerator to your Azure subscription. If you haven't deployed the solution accelerator, follow the steps in the [Deploy and run a cloud-based device simulation solution](quickstart-device-simulation-deploy.md) quickstart.

This article assumes the name of your solution accelerator is **contoso-simulation**. Replace **contoso-simulation** with the name of your solution accelerator as you complete the following steps.

The Time Series Insights explorer is a web app you can use to visualize your telemetry.

1. In the Azure portal, select the Time Series Insights **Overview** tab.

1. To open the Time Series Insights explorer web app, click **Go to Environment**:

1. Click the perspective view button:

    ![Time Series Insights explorer perspective](./media/iot-accelerators-device-simulation-time-series-insights/time-series-insights-explorer-perspective.png)

1. Click **+** to add a new query to the perspective:
