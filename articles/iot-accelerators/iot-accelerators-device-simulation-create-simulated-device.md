# <a name="create-and-test-a-new-simulated-device"></a>Create and test a new simulated device

The Device Simulation solution accelerator lets you define your own simulated devices. This article shows you how to define a new simulated lightbulb device and then test it locally. The solution accelerator includes simulated devices such as chillers and trucks. However, you can define your own simulated devices to test your IoT solutions before you deploy real devices.

This how-to guide shows you how to customize the device simulation microservice. This microservice is part of the Device Simulation solution accelerator. To show the device simulation capabilities, this how-to guide uses two scenarios in the Contoso IoT application:

[!INCLUDE [iot-solution-accelerators-create-device](../../includes/iot-solution-accelerators-create-device.md)]

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

This guide showed you how to create a custom simulated device types and test them by running the device simulation microservice locally.

The suggested next step is to learn how to deploy your custom simulated device types to the [Device Simulation solution accelerator](iot-accelerators-device-simulation-deploy-simulated-device.md).
