# <a name="ethereum-proof-of-authority-consortium"></a>Ethereum proof-of-authority consortium

[This solution](https://portal.azure.com/?pub_source=email&pub_status=success#create/microsoft-azure-blockchain.azure-blockchain-ethereumethereum-poa-consortium) is designed to make it easier to deploy, configure, and govern a multi-member consortium Proof-of-authority Ethereum network with minimal Azure and Ethereum knowledge.

With a handful of user inputs and a single-click deployment through the Azure portal, each member can provision a network footprint, using Microsoft Azure Compute, networking, and storage services across the globe. Each member's network footprint consists of a set of load-balanced validator nodes with which an application or user can interact to submit Ethereum transactions.

## <a name="concepts"></a>Concepts

### <a name="terminology"></a>Terminology

-   **Consensus** - The act of synchronizing data across the distributed network through block validation and creation.

-   **Consortium member** - An entity that participates in consensus on the Blockchain network.

-   **Admin** - An Ethereum account that is used to manage participation for a given consortium member.

-   **Validator** - A machine associated with an Ethereum account that participates in consensus on behalf of an Admin.

### <a name="proof-of-authority"></a>Proof-of-authority

For those of you who are new to the blockchain community, the release of this solution is a great opportunity to learn about the technology in an easy and configurable manner on Azure. Proof-of-work is a Sybil-resistance mechanism that leverages computation costs to self-regulate the network and allow fair participation. This works great in anonymous, open blockchain networks where competition for cryptocurrency promotes security on the network. However, in private/consortium networks the underlying Ether has no value. An alternative protocol, proof-of-authority, is more suitable for permissioned networks where all consensus participants are known and reputable. Without the need for mining, Proof-of-authority is more efficient while still retaining Byzantine fault tolerance.

### <a name="consortium-governance"></a>Consortium governance

Since proof-of-authority relies upon a permissioned list of network authorities to keep the network healthy, it's important to provide a fair mechanism to make modifications to this permission list. Each deployment comes with a set of smart-contracts and portal for on-chain governance of this permissioned list. Once a proposed change reaches a majority vote by consortium members, the change is enacted. This allows new consensus participants to be added or compromised participants to be removed in a transparent way that encourages an honest network.

### <a name="admin-account"></a>Admin account

During the deployment of the proof-of-authority nodes, you will be asked for an Admin Ethereum address. You may use several different mechanisms to generate and secure this Ethereum account. Once this address is added as an authority on the network, you can use this account to participate in governance. This admin account will also be used to delegate consensus participation to the validator nodes that are created as part of this deployment. Since only the public Ethereum address is used, each admin has the flexibility to secure their private keys in a way that complies with their desired security model.

### <a name="validator-node"></a>Validator node

In the proof-of-authority protocol, validator nodes take the place of traditional miner nodes. Each validator has a unique Ethereum identity that gets added to a smart-contract permission list. Once a validator is on this list, it can participate in the block creation process. To learn more about this process, see Parity's documentation on [Authority Round consensus](https://wiki.parity.io/Aura). Each consortium member can provision two or more validator nodes across five regions, for geo-redundancy. Validator nodes communicate with other validator nodes to come to consensus on the state of the underlying distributed ledger.
To ensure fair participation on the network, each consortium member is prohibited from using more validators than the first member on the network (if the first member deploys three validators, each member can only have up to three validators).

### <a name="identity-store"></a>Identity store

Since each member will have multiple validator nodes running simultaneously and each node must have a permissioned identity, it's important that the validators can safely acquire a unique active identity on the network. To facilitate this, we've built an Identity Store that gets deployed in each member's subscription which securely holds the generated Ethereum identities. Upon deployment the orchestration container will generate an Ethereum private key for each validator and store it in Azure Key Vault. Before the parity node starts up, it first acquires a lease on an unused identity to ensure the identity isn't picked up by another node. The identity is provided to the client which gives it the authority to start creating blocks. If the hosting VM experiences an outage, the identity lease will be released, allowing a replacement node to resume its identity in the future.

### <a name="bootnode-registrar"></a>Bootnode registrar

To enable the ease of connectivity, each member will host a set of connection information at the [data API endpoint](#data-api). This data includes a list of bootnodes which are provided as peering nodes for the joining member. As part of this data API, we keep this bootnode list up-to-date

### <a name="bring-your-own-operator"></a>Bring your own operator

Often a consortium member will want to participate in network governance but don't want to operate and maintain their infrastructure. Unlike traditional systems, having a single operator across the network works against the decentralized model of blockchain systems. Instead of hiring a centralized intermediary to operate a network, each consortium member can delegate infrastructure management to the operator of their choosing. This allows a hybrid model where each member can choose to operate his or her own infrastructure or delegate operation to a different partner. The delegated operation workflow works as follows:

1.  **Consortium Member** generates an Ethereum address (holds private key)

2.  **Consortium Member** provides public Ethereum address to **Operator**

3.  **Operator** deploys and configures the PoA validator nodes using our Azure Resource Manager solution

4.  **Operator** provides the RPC and management endpoint to **Consortium Member**

5.  **Consortium Member** uses their private key to sign a request accepting the validator nodes **Operator** has deployed to participate on their behalf

![Bring your own operator](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/bring-you-own-operator.png)

### <a name="azure-monitor"></a>Azure Monitor

This solution also comes with Azure Monitor to track node and network statistics. For application developers, this provides visibility into the underlying blockchain to track block generation statistics. Network operators can use Azure Monitor to quickly detect and prevent network outages through infrastructure statistics and queryable logs. See [Service monitoring](#service-monitoring) for more details.

### <a name="deployment-architecture"></a>Deployment architecture

#### <a name="description"></a>Description

This solution can deploy a single or multi-region based multi-member Ethereum consortium network. By default, the RPC and peering endpoints are accessible over public IP to enable simplified connectivity across subscriptions and clouds. We recommend leveraging [Parity's permissioning contracts](https://wiki.parity.io/Permissioning) for application level access-controls. We also support networks deployed behind VPNs, which leverage VNet gateways for cross-subscription connectivity. These deployments are more complex, so it is recommended to start with the public IP model first.

#### <a name="consortium-member-overview"></a>Consortium member overview

Each consortium member deployment includes:

-   Virtual M Scale Sets (VMSS) for running the PoA validators

-   Azure Load Balancer for distributing RPC, peering, and Governance DApp requests

-   Azure Key Vault for securing the validator identities

-   Azure Storage for hosting persistent network information and coordinating leasing

-   Azure Monitor for aggregating logs and performance statistics

-   VNet Gateway (optional) for allowing VPN connections across private VNets

![deployment architecture](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/deployment-architecture.png)

We leverage Docker containers for reliability and modularity. We use Azure Container Registry to host and serve versioned images as part of each deployment. The container images consist of:

-   Orchestrator

    -   Runs once during deployment

    -   Generates identities and governance contracts

    -   Stores identities in Identity Store

-   Parity Client

    -   Leases identity from Identity Store

    -   Discovers and connects to peers

-   EthStats Agent

    -   Collects local logs and stats via RPC and pushes to Azure Monitor

-   Governance DApp

    -   Web interface for interacting with Governance contracts

## <a name="governance-dapp"></a>Governance DApp

At the heart of proof-of-authority is decentralized governance. The governance DApp is a set of pre-deployed smart contracts and a web application that are used to govern the authorities on the network.
Authorities are broken up into Admin identities and Validator nodes.
Admins have the power to delegate consensus participation to a set of Validator nodes. Admins also may vote other admins into or out of the network.

![governance dapp](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/governance-dapp.png)

-   **Decentralized Governance -** Changes in network authorities are administered through on-chain voting by select administrators.

-   **Validator Delegation -** Authorities can manage their validator nodes that are set up in each PoA deployment.

-   **Auditable Change History -** Each change is recorded on the blockchain providing transparency and auditability.

## <a name="how-to-guides"></a>How-to guides

### <a name="deploy-ethereum-proof-of-authority"></a>Deploy Ethereum Proof-of-Authority

Here's an example of a multi-party deployment flow:

1.  Three members each generate an Ethereum account using MetaMask

2.  *Member A* deploys Ethereum PoA, providing their Ethereum Public Address

3.  *Member A* provides the consortium URL to *Member B* and *Member C*

4.  *Member B* and *Member C* deploy, Ethereum PoA, providing their Ethereum Public Address and *Member A*'s consortium URL

5.  *Member A* votes in *Member B* as an admin

6.  *Member A* and *Member B* both vote *Member C* as an admin

This process requires an Azure subscription that can support deploying several virtual machines scale sets and managed disks. If necessary, [create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to begin.

Once a subscription is secured, go to Azure portal. Select '+', Marketplace ('See all'), and search for Ethereum PoA Consortium.

The following section will walk you through configuring the first member's footprint in the network. The deployment flow is divided into five steps: Basics, Deployment regions, Network size and performance, Ethereum settings, Azure Monitor.

#### <a name="basics"></a>Basics

Under **Basics**, specify values for standard parameters for any deployment, such as subscription, resource group and basic virtual machine properties.

A detailed description of each parameter follows:

Parameter Name|Description|Allowed Values|Default Values    
---|---|---|---

A sample deployment is shown below: ![basic blade](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/basic-blade.png)

#### <a name="deployment-regions"></a>Deployment regions

Next, under Deployment regions, specify inputs for number of region(s) to deploy the consortium network and selection of Azure regions based on the number of regions given. User can deploy in maximum of 5 regions. We recommend choosing the first region to match the resource group location from Basics section. For development or test networks, a single region per member is recommended. For production, we recommend deploying across two or more regions for high-availability.

A detailed description of each parameter follows:

  Parameter Name|Description|Allowed Values|Default Values
  ---|---|---|---
  Number of region(s)|Number of regions to deploy the consortium network|1, 2, 3, 4, 5|1
  First region|First region to deploy the consortium network|All allowed Azure regions|NA
  Second region|Second region to deploy the consortium network (Visible only when number of regions is selected as 2)|All allowed Azure regions|NA
  Third region|Third region to deploy the consortium network (Visible only when number of regions is selected as 3)|All allowed Azure regions|NA
  Fourth region|Fourth region to deploy the consortium network (Visible only when number of regions is selected as 4)|All allowed Azure regions|NA
  Fifth region|Fifth region to deploy the consortium network (Visible only when number of regions is selected as 5)|All allowed Azure regions|NA

A sample deployment is shown below: ![deployment regions](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/deployment-regions.png)

#### <a name="network-size-and-performance"></a>Network size and performance 

Next, under 'Network size and performance' specify inputs for the size of the consortium network, such as number and size of validator nodes.
The validator node storage size will dictate the potential size of the blockchain. This can be changed after deployment.

A detailed description of each parameter follows:

  Parameter Name|Description|Allowed Values|Default Values
  ---|---|---|---
  Number of load balanced validator nodes|The number of validator nodes to provision as part of the network|2-15|2
  Validator node storage performance|The type of managed disk backing each of the deployed validator nodes.|Standard or Premium|Standard
  Validator node virtual machine size|The virtual machine size used for validator nodes.|Standard A, Standard D, Standard D-v2, Standard F series, Standard DS, and Standard FS|Standard D1 v2

A sample deployment is shown below: ![network size and performance](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/network-size-and-performance.png)

#### <a name="ethereum-settings"></a>Ethereum Settings

Next, under Ethereum settings, specify Ethereum-related configuration settings, like the network ID and Ethereum account password or genesis block.

A detailed description of each parameter follows:

  Parameter Name|Description|Allowed Values|Default Values
  ---|---|---|---
Consortium Member ID|The ID associated with each member participating in the consortium network used to configure IP address spaces to avoid collision. In the case of a private network, Member ID should be unique across different organizations in the same network.  A unique member ID is needed even when the same organization deploys to multiple regions. Make note of the value of this parameter since you will need to share it with other joining members to ensure there’s no collision.|0-255|NA

Transaction Permission Contract (Advanced Options = Enable)|Bytecode for the Transaction Permissioning contract. Restricts smart contract deployment and execution to a permissioned list of Ethereum accounts.|Contract bytecode|NA

A sample deployment is shown below: ![ethereum settings](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/ethereum-settings.png)

#### <a name="azure-monitor"></a>Azure Monitor

The Azure Monitor blade allows you to configure an Azure Monitor resource for your network. Azure Monitor will collect and surface useful metrics and logs from your network, providing the ability to quickly check the network health or debug issues.

  Parameter Name|Description|Allowed Values|Default Values
  ---|---|---|---
Monitoring|Option to enable Azure Monitor|Enable or Disable|Enable

Existing Log Analytics Primary Key (Connect to Existing Azure Monitor = Join Existing)|The primary key used to connect to the existing Azure Monitor instance||NA


A sample deployment is shown below: ![azure monitor](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/azure-monitor.png)

#### <a name="summary"></a>Summary

Click through the summary blade to review the inputs specified and to run basic pre-deployment validation. Before deploying you may download the template and parameters.

Review legal and privacy terms and click 'Purchase' to deploy. If the deployment includes VNet Gateways, the deployment will take up 45 to 50 minutes.

#### <a name="post-deployment"></a>Post Deployment

##### <a name="deployment-output"></a>Deployment Output 

Once the deployment has completed, you'll be able to access the necessary parameters via the confirmation email or through the Azure portal. In these parameters you'll find:

-   Ethereum RPC endpoint

-   Governance Dashboard URL

-   Azure Monitor URL

-   Data URL

-   VNet Gateway Resource Id (optional)

##### <a name="confirmation-email"></a>Confirmation Email 

If you provide an email address ([Basics Section](#basics)), an email would be sent to the email address with the deployment output information.

![deployment email](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/deployment-email.png)

##### <a name="portal"></a>Portal

Once the deployment has completed successfully and all resources have been provisioned you'll be able to view the output parameters in your resource group.

1.  Locate your resource group in the portal

2.  Navigate to *Deployments*

3.  Select the top deployment with the same name as your resource group

4.  Select *Outputs*

### <a name="growing-the-consortium"></a>Growing the consortium

To expand your consortium, you must first connect the physical network.
Using the Public IP-based deployment this first step is seamless. If deploying behind a VPN, see the section [Connecting VNet Gateway](#connecting-vnet-gateways) to perform the network connection as part of [Step 2](#step-2-new-admin-deployment).

#### <a name="step-1-add-the-new-admin"></a>Step 1: Add the new admin

1.  Collect the new admin's public Ethereum address.

2.  Navigate to the Governance DApp and create a new admin with the Ethereum address and an appropriate alias

3.  Notify the other existing members of the new request so that they can vote to add this new admin

4.  Once the vote reaches the 51%, the member will be added as an admin

![adding admin](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/adding-admin.png)

#### <a name="step-2-new-admin-deployment"></a>Step 2: New admin deployment

1.  Share the following information with the joining member. This information can be found in your post-deployment email or in the portal deployment output.

    -  Consortium Data Url

    -  The number of nodes you've deployed

    -  VNet Gateway Resource Id (if using VPN)

2.  The deploying member should use the [same solution](https://portal.azure.com/?pub_source=email&pub_status=success#create/microsoft-azure-blockchain.azure-blockchain-ethereumethereum-poa-consortium) when deploying their network presence with keeping the following in mind:

    -  Select *Join Existing*

    -  Choose the same number of validator nodes as the rest of the  members on the network to ensure fair representation

    -  Use the same Ethereum address that was provided in the [previous  step](#step-1-add-the-new-admin)

    -  Pass in the provided *Consortium Data Url* on the *Ethereum  Settings* tab

    -  If the rest of the network is behind a VPN, select *Private  VNet* under the advanced section

#### <a name="step-3-delegate-validators"></a>Step 3: Delegate validators

The new admin will need to authorize the validators to participate on their behalf. This cannot be done automatically since only the member controls their keys.\*

_\*The first member's nodes on the network can automatically be added because we can precompile their validator nodes into the genesis block on the network._

The new admin must perform the following steps:

1.  Open the Governance DApp deployed as part of *their* deployment

2.  Navigate to the Validators tab

3.  Select each of the validators that have been deployed and click **Add**

![adding validators](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/adding-validators.png)

#### <a name="connecting-vnet-gateways"></a>Connecting VNet gateways

In the case of a private network, the different members are connected via VNet gateway connections. Before a member can join the network and see transaction traffic, an existing member must perform a final configuration on their VPN gateway to accept the connection. This means that the Ethereum nodes of the joining member will not run until a connection is established. It is recommended to create redundant network connections (mesh) into the consortium to reduce chances of a single point of failure.

After the new member deploys, the existing member must complete the bi-directional connection by setting up a VNet gateway connection to the new member. To achieve this existing member will need:

1.  The VNet gateway ResourceId of the connecting member (see deployment output)

2.  The shared connection key

The existing member must run the following PowerShell script to complete the connection. We recommend using Azure Cloud Shell located in the top right navigation bar in the portal.

![cloud shell](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/cloud-shell.png)

```bash
$MyGatewayResourceId = "<EXISTING_MEMBER_RESOURCEID>"
$OtherGatewayResourceId = "<NEW_MEMBER_RESOURCEID]"
$ConnectionName = "Leader2Member"
$SharedKey = "<NEW_MEMBER_KEY>"

## $myGatewayResourceId tells me what subscription I am in, what ResourceGroup and the VNetGatewayName
$splitValue = $MyGatewayResourceId.Split('/')
$MySubscriptionid = $splitValue[2]
$MyResourceGroup = $splitValue[4]
$MyGatewayName = $splitValue[8]

## $otherGatewayResourceid tells me what the subscription and VNet GatewayName are
$OtherGatewayName = $OtherGatewayResourceId.Split('/')[8]
$Subscription=Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId $MySubscriptionid

## create a PSVirtualNetworkGateway instance for the gateway I want to connect to
$OtherGateway=New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models.PSVirtualNetworkGateway
$OtherGateway.Name = $OtherGatewayName
$OtherGateway.Id = $OtherGatewayResourceId
$OtherGateway.GatewayType = "Vpn"
$OtherGateway.VpnType = "RouteBased"

## get a PSVirtualNetworkGateway instance for my gateway
$MyGateway = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $MyGatewayName -ResourceGroupName $MyResourceGroup

## create the connection
New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $ConnectionName -ResourceGroupName $MyResourceGroup -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $MyGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway2 $OtherGateway -Location $MyGateway.Location -ConnectionType Vnet2Vnet -SharedKey $SharedKey -EnableBgp $True
```

### <a name="service-monitoring"></a>Service monitoring

You can locate your Azure Monitor portal either by following the link in the deployment email or locating the parameter in the deployment output \[OMS\_PORTAL\_URL\].

The portal will first display high-level network statistics and node overview.

![monitor categories](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/monitor-categories.png)

Selecting **Node Overview** will direct you to a portal to view per-node infrastructure statistics.

![node stats](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/node-stats.png)

Selecting **Network Stats** will direct you to view Ethereum network statistics.

![network stats](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/network-stats.png)

#### <a name="sample-log-analytics-queries"></a>Sample Log Analytics queries

Behind these dashboards is a set of queryable raw logs. You can use these raw logs to customize the dashboards, investigate failures, or setup threshold alerting. Below you'll find a set of example queries that can be ran in the Log Search tool:

##### <a name="lists-blocks-that-have-been-reported-by-more-than-one-validator-useful-to-help-find-chain-forks"></a>Lists blocks that have been reported by more than one validator. Useful to help find chain forks.

```sql
MinedBlock_CL
| summarize DistinctMiners = dcount(BlockMiner_s) by BlockNumber_d, BlockMiner_s
| where DistinctMiners > 1
```

##### <a name="get-average-peer-count-for-a-specified-validator-node-averaged-over-5-minute-buckets"></a>Get average peer count for a specified validator node averaged over 5 minute buckets.

```sql
let PeerCountRegex = @"Syncing with peers: (\d+) active, (\d+) confirmed, (\d+)";
ParityLog_CL
| where Computer == "vl-devn3lgdm-reg1000001"
| project RawData, TimeGenerated
| where RawData matches regex PeerCountRegex
| extend ActivePeers = extract(PeerCountRegex, 1, RawData, typeof(int)) 
| summarize avg(ActivePeers) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
```

### <a name="ssh-access"></a>SSH access

For security reasons, the SSH port access is denied by a network group security rule by default. To access the virtual machine scale set instances in the PoA network, you will need to change this rule to \"Allow\"

1.  Start in the Overview section of the deployed resource group from Azure portal.

    ![ssh overview](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/ssh-overview.png)

2.  Select the Network Security Group

    ![ssh nsg](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/ssh-nsg.png)

3.  Select the \"allow-ssh\" rule

    ![ssh-allow](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/ssh-allow.png)

4.  Change \"Action\" to Allow

    ![ssh enable allow](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/ssh-enable-allow.png)

5.  Click \"Save\" (Changes may take a few minutes to apply)

You can now remotely connect to the virtual machines for the validator nodes via SSH with your provided admin username and password/SSH key.
The SSH command to run to access the first validator node is listed in the template deployment output parameter as, 'SSH\_TO\_FIRST\_VL\_NODE\_REGION1' (for the sample deployment: ssh - p 4000 poaadmin\@leader4vb.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com). To get to additional transaction nodes, increment the port number by one (For example, the first transaction node is on port 4000).

If you deployed to more than one region, change the above command to the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer in that region. To find the DNS name or IP address of the other regions, find the resource with the naming convention \*\*\*\*\*-lbpip-reg\#, and view its DNS name and IP address properties.

### <a name="azure-traffic-manager-load-balancing"></a>Azure Traffic Manager load balancing

Azure Traffic Manager can help reduce downtime and improve responsiveness of the PoA network by routing incoming traffic across multiple deployments in different regions. Built-in health checks and automatic re-routing help ensure high availability of the RPC endpoints and the Governance DApp. This feature is useful if you have deployed to multiple regions and are production ready.

Use Traffic Manager to:

-   Improve PoA network availability with automatic failover.

-   Increase your networks responsiveness by routing end users to the Azure location with lowest network latency.

If you decide to create a Traffic Manager profile, you can use the DNS name of the profile to access your network. Once other consortium members have been added to the network, the Traffic Manager can also be used to load balance across their deployed validators.

#### <a name="creating-a-traffic-manager-profile"></a>Creating a Traffic Manager profile

Search for and select \"Traffic Manager profile\" after clicking the \"Create a resource\" button in the Azure portal.

![search for azure traffic manager](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/traffic-manager-search.png)

Give the profile a unique name and select the Resource Group that was created during the PoA deployment.

![create traffic manager](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/traffic-manager-create.png)

Once it is deployed, then select the instance in the resource group. The DNS name to access the traffic manager can be found in the Overview tab

![Locate traffic manager DNS](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/traffic-manager-dns.png)

Select the Endpoints tab and click the Add button. Then change the Target resource type to Public IP address. Then select the public IP address of the first region\'s load balancer.

![Routing traffic manager](./media/ethereum-poa-deployment-guide/traffic-manager-routing.png)

Repeat for each region in the deployed network. Once the endpoints are in the \"enabled\" status, they will be automatically load and region balanced at the DNS name of the traffic manager. You can now use this DNS name in place of the \[CONSORTIUM\_DATA\_URL\] parameter in other steps of the document.

## <a name="data-api"></a>Data API

Each consortium member hosts the necessary information for others to connect to the network. The existing member will provide the [CONSORTIUM_DATA_URL] prior to the member's deployment. Upon deployment, a joining member will retrieve information from the JSON interface at the following endpoint:

`<CONSORTIUM_DATA_URL>/networkinfo`

The response will contain information useful for joining members (Genesis block, Validator Set contract ABI, bootnodes) as well as information useful to the existing member (validator addresses). We encourage use of this standardization to extend the consortium across cloud providers. This API will return a JSON formatted response with the following structure:
```json
{
  "$id": "", 
  "type": "object", 
  "definitions": {}, 
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#", 
  "properties": {

      ]
    }, 
    "minorVersion": {
      "$id": "/properties/minorVersion", 
      "type": "integer", 
      "title": "This schema’s minor version", 
      "default": 0, 
      "examples": [

    }, 
    "bootnodes": {
      "$id": "/properties/bootnodes", 
      "type": "array", 
      "items": {

> [!WARNING]
> Never send your Ethereum private key over the network! Ensure that each transaction is signed locally first and the signed transaction is sent over the network.

In the following example, we use *ethereumjs-wallet* to generate an Ethereum address, *ethereumjs-tx* to sign locally, and *web3* to send the raw transaction to the Ethereum RPC endpoint.

We'll use this simple Hello-World smart contract for this example:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.11;
contract postBox {
    string message;
    function postMsg(string text) public {
        message = text; 
    }
    function getMsg() public view returns (string) {
        return message;
    }
}
```

This example assumes the contract is already deployed. You can use *solc* and *web3* for deploying a contract programmatically. First install the following node modules:
```
sudo npm install web3@0.20.2
sudo npm install ethereumjs-tx@1.3.6
sudo npm install ethereumjs-wallet@0.6.1
```
This nodeJS script will perform the following:

-   Construct a raw transaction: postMsg

-   Sign the transaction using the generated private key

-   Submit the signed transaction to the Ethereum network

```javascript
var ethereumjs = require('ethereumjs-tx')
var wallet = require('ethereumjs-wallet')
var Web3 = require('web3')

// TODO Replace with your contract address
var address = "0xfe53559f5f7a77125039a993e8d5d9c2901edc58";
var abi = [{"constant": false,"inputs": [{"name": "text","type": "string"}],"name": "postMsg","outputs": [],"payable": false,"stateMutability": "nonpayable","type": "function"},{"constant": true,"inputs": [],"name": "getMsg","outputs": [{"name": "","type": "string"}],"payable": false,"stateMutability": "view","type": "function"}];

// Generate a new Ethereum account
var account = wallet.generate();
var accountAddress = account.getAddressString()
var privateKey = account.getPrivateKey();

 // TODO Replace with your RPC endpoint
 var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(
    "http://testzvdky-dns-reg1.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:8545"));
 
// Get the current nonce of the account
 web3.eth.getTransactionCount(accountAddress, function (err, nonce) {
   var data = web3.eth.contract(abi).at(address).postMsg.getData("Hello World");
   var rawTx = {
     nonce: nonce,
     gasPrice: '0x00', 
     gasLimit: '0x2FAF080',
     to: address, 
     value: '0x00', 
     data: data
   }
   var tx = new ethereumjs(rawTx);
   
   tx.sign(privateKey);

   var raw = '0x' + tx.serialize().toString('hex');
   web3.eth.sendRawTransaction(raw, function (txErr, transactionHash) {
     console.log("TX Hash: " + transactionHash);
     console.log("Error: " + txErr);
   });
 });
```

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ

### <a name="i-notice-a-bunch-of-transactions-on-the-network-that-i-didnt-send-where-are-these-coming-from"></a>I notice a bunch of transactions on the network that I didn\'t send. Where are these coming from?

It is insecure to unlock the [personal API](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-personal.html). Bot accounts are listening for unlocked Ethereum accounts and attempt to drain the funds. The bot assumes these accounts contain real-ether and attempt to be the first to siphon the balance. Do not enable the personal API on the network. Instead pre-sign the transactions either manually using a wallet like MetaMask or programmatically as outlined in the section Programmatically Interacting with a Smart Contract.

### <a name="how-to-ssh-onto-a-vm"></a>How to SSH onto a VM?

We lock down the SSH port for security reasons. Follow [this guide to enable the SSH port](#_Accessing_Nodes_via).

### <a name="how-do-i-set-up-an-audit-member-or-transaction-nodes"></a>How do I set up an audit member or transaction nodes?

Transaction nodes are a set of Parity clients that are peered with the network but are not participating in consensus. These nodes can still be used to submit Ethereum transactions and read the smart contract state.
This works well as a mechanism for providing auditability to regulators of the network. To achieve this simply follow Step 2 from Growing the Consortium.

### <a name="why-are-metamask-transactions-taking-a-long-time"></a>Why are MetaMask transactions taking a long time?

To ensure transactions are received in the correct order, each Ethereum transaction comes with an incrementing nonce. If you've used an account in MetaMask on a different network, you'll need to reset the nonce value. Click on the settings icon (3-bars), Settings, Reset Account. The transaction history will be cleared and now you can resubmit the transaction.

### <a name="are-public-ip-deployments-compatible-with-private-network-deployments"></a>Are Public IP deployments compatible with Private network deployments?

No, peering requires two-way communication so the entire network must either be public or private.
