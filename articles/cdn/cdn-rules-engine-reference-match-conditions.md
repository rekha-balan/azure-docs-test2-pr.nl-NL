# <a name="azure-cdn-rules-engine-match-conditions"></a>Azure CDN rules engine match conditions
This topic lists detailed descriptions of the available Match Conditions for Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) [Rules Engine](cdn-rules-engine.md).

The second part of a rule is the match condition. A match condition identifies specific types of requests for which a set of features will be performed.

For example, it may be used to filter requests for content at a particular location, requests generated from a particular IP address or country, or by header information.

## <a name="always"></a>Always

The Always match condition is designed to apply a default set of features to all requests.

## <a name="device"></a>Device

The Device match condition identifies requests made from a mobile device based on its properties.  Mobile device detection is achieved through [WURFL](http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/).  WURFL capabilities and their CDN Rules Engine variables are listed below.

> [!NOTE] 
> The variables below are supported in the **Modify Client Request Header** and **Modify Client Response Header** features.
