# <a name="azure-cdn-rules-engine"></a>Azure CDN rules engine
This topic lists detailed descriptions of the available match conditions and features for Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) [Rules Engine](cdn-rules-engine.md).

The HTTP Rules Engine is designed to be the final authority on how specific types of requests are processed by the CDN.

**Common uses**:

- Override or define a custom cache policy.
- Secure or deny requests for sensitive content.
- Redirect requests.
- Store custom log data.

## <a name="terminology"></a>Terminology
A rule is defined through the use of [**conditional expressions**](cdn-rules-engine-reference-conditional-expressions.md), [**matches**](cdn-rules-engine-reference-match-conditions.md), and [**features**](cdn-rules-engine-reference-features.md). These elements are highlighted in the following illustration.

## <a name="syntax"></a>Syntax

The manner in which special characters will be treated varies according to how a match condition or feature handles text values. A match condition or feature may interpret text in one of the following ways:

1. [**Literal Values**](#literal-values) 
2. [**Wildcard Values**](#wildcard-values)
3. [**Regular Expressions**](#regular-expressions)

### <a name="literal-values"></a>Literal Values
Text that is interpreted as a literal value will treat all special characters, with the exception of the % symbol, as a part of the value that must be matched. In other words, a literal match condition set to `\'*'\` will only be satisfied when that exact value (i.e., `\'*'\`) is found.
 
A percentage symbol is used to indicate URL encoding (e.g., `%20`).

### <a name="wildcard-values"></a>Wildcard Values
Text that is interpreted as a wildcard value will assign additional meaning to special characters. The following table describes how the following set of characters will be interpreted.

Character | Description
----------|------------
\ | A backslash is used to escape any of the characters specified in this table. A backslash must be specified directly before the special character that should be escaped.<br/>For example, the following syntax escapes an asterisk: `\*`
% | A percentage symbol is used to indicate URL encoding (e.g., `%20`).
* | An asterisk is a wildcard that represents one or more characters.
Space | A space character indicates that a match condition may be satisfied by either of the specified values or patterns.
'value' | A single quote does not have special meaning. However, a set of single quotes is used to indicate that a value should be treated as a literal value. It can be used in the following ways:<br><br/>- It allows a match condition to be satisfied whenever the specified value matches any portion of the comparison value.  For example, `'ma'` would match any of the following strings: <br/><br/>/business/**ma**rathon/asset.htm<br/>**ma**p.gif<br/>/business/template.**ma**p<br /><br />- It allows a special character to be specified as a literal character. For example, you may specify a literal space character by enclosing a space character within a set of single quotes (i.e., `' '` or `'sample value'`).<br/>- It allows a blank value to be specified. Specify a blank value by specifying a set of single quotes (i.e., '').<br /><br/>**Important:**<br/>- If the specified value does not contain a wildcard, then it will automatically be considered a literal value. This means that it is not necessary to specify a set of single quotes.<br/>- If a backslash does not escape another character in this table, then it will be ignored when specified within a set of single quotes.<br/>- Another way to specify a special character as a literal character is to escape it using a backslash (i.e., `\`).

### <a name="regular-expressions"></a>Regular Expressions

Regular expressions define a pattern that will be searched for within a text value. Regular expression notation defines specific meanings to a variety of symbols. The following table indicates how special characters are treated by match conditions and features that support regular expressions.

Special Character | Description
------------------|------------
\ | A backslash escapes the character the follows it. This causes that character to be treated as a literal value instead of taking on its regular expression meaning. For example, the following syntax escapes an asterisk: `\*`
% | The meaning of a percentage symbol depends on its usage.<br/><br/> `%{HTTPVariable}`: This syntax identifies an HTTP variable.<br/>`%{HTTPVariable%Pattern}`: This syntax uses a percentage symbol to identify an HTTP variable and as a delimiter.<br />`\%`: Escaping a percentage symbol allows it to be used as a literal value or to indicate URL encoding (e.g., `\%20`).
* | An asterisk allows the preceding character to be matched zero or more times. 
Space | A space character is typically treated as a literal character. 
'value' | Single quotes are treated as literal characters. A set of single quotes does not have special meaning.
