# <a name="relay-exceptions"></a>Relay exceptions

This article lists some exceptions generated by the Microsoft Azure Relay APIs. This reference is subject to change, so check back for updates.

## <a name="exception-categories"></a>Exception categories

The Relay APIs generate exceptions that can fall into the following categories, along with the associated action you can take to try to fix them.

1. User coding error ([System.ArgumentException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentexception.aspx), [System.InvalidOperationException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.invalidoperationexception.aspx), [System.OperationCanceledException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.operationcanceledexception.aspx), [System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.serialization.serializationexception.aspx)). General action: try to fix the code before proceeding.
2. Setup/configuration error ([Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingEntityNotFoundException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingentitynotfoundexception), [System.UnauthorizedAccessException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.unauthorizedaccessexception.aspx). General action: review your configuration and change if necessary.
3. Transient exceptions ([Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.ServerBusyException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.serverbusyexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingCommunicationException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingcommunicationexception.aspx)). General action: retry the operation or notify users.
4. Other exceptions ([System.Transactions.TransactionException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.transactions.transactionexception.aspx), [System.TimeoutException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessageLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagelocklostexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.SessionLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sessionlocklostexception)). General action: specific to the exception type; please refer to the table in the following section. 

## <a name="exception-types"></a>Exception types

The following table lists messaging exception types, and their causes, and notes suggested action you can take.

| **Exception Type** | **Description** | **Suggested Action** | **Note on automatic or immediate retry** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Timeout](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx) |The server did not respond to the requested operation within the specified time which is controlled by [OperationTimeout](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactorysettings.operationtimeout). The server may have completed the requested operation. This can happen due to network or other infrastructure delays. |Check the system state for consistency and retry if necessary. See [Timeout exceptions](#timeoutexception). |Retry might help in some cases; add retry logic to code. |
| [Invalid Operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.invalidoperationexception.aspx) |The requested user operation is not allowed within the server or service. See the exception message for details. For example, [Complete](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.complete) will generate this exception if the message was received in **ReceiveAndDelete** mode. |Check the code and the documentation. Make sure the requested operation is valid. |Retry will not help. |
| [Operation Canceled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.operationcanceledexception.aspx) |An attempt is made to invoke an operation on an object that has already been closed, aborted or disposed. In rare cases, the ambient transaction is already disposed. |Check the code and make sure it does not invoke operations on a disposed object. |Retry will not help. |
| [Unauthorized Access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.unauthorizedaccessexception.aspx) |The [TokenProvider](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.tokenprovider) object could not acquire a token, the token is invalid, or the token does not contain the claims required to perform the operation. |Make sure the token provider is created with the correct values. Check the configuration of the Access Control service. |Retry might help in some cases; add retry logic to code. |
| [Argument Exception](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentexception.aspx)<br /> [Argument Null](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentnullexception.aspx)<br />[Argument Out Of Range](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentoutofrangeexception.aspx) |One or more arguments supplied to the method are invalid.<br /> The URI supplied to [NamespaceManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager) or [Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactory.create) contains path segment(s).<br /> The URI scheme supplied to [NamespaceManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager) or [Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactory.create) is invalid. <br />The property value is larger than 32KB. |Check the calling code and make sure the arguments are correct. |Retry will not help. |
| [Server Busy](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.serverbusyexception) |Service is not able to process the request at this time. |Client can wait for a period of time, then retry the operation. |Client may retry after certain interval. If a retry results in a different exception, check retry behavior of that exception. |
| [Quota Exceeded](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.quotaexceededexception) |The messaging entity has reached its maximum allowable size. |Create space in the entity by receiving messages from the entity or its sub-queues. See [QuotaExceededException](#quotaexceededexception). |Retry might help if messages have been removed in the meantime. |
| [Message Size Exceeded](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagesizeexceededexception) |A message payload exceeds the 256K limit. Note that the 256k limit is the total message size, which can include system properties and any .NET overhead. |Reduce the size of the message payload, then retry the operation. |Retry will not help. |

## <a name="quotaexceededexception"></a>QuotaExceededException

[QuotaExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.quotaexceededexception) indicates that a quota for a specific entity has been exceeded.

For Relay, this exception wraps the [System.ServiceModel.QuotaExceededException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.servicemodel.quotaexceededexception.aspx), indicating that the maximum number of listeners has been exceeded for this endpoint. This is indicated in the **MaximumListenersPerEndpoint** value of the exception message.

## <a name="timeoutexception"></a>TimeoutException
A [TimeoutException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx) indicates that a user-initiated operation is taking longer than the operation timeout. 

You should check the value of the [ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.defaultconnectionlimit) property, as hitting this limit can also cause a [TimeoutException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx).

For Relay, you might receive timeout exceptions when first opening a relay sender connection. There are two common causes for this exception:

1. The [OpenTimeout](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/wcf.opentimeout.aspx) value might be too small (even a fraction of a second).
2. The on-premises relay listener(s) may not be responsive (or might encounter firewall rules issues prohibiting the listeners from accepting new client connections), and the [OpenTimeout](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/wcf.opentimeout.aspx) value is less than about 20 seconds.

For example:

```
'System.TimeoutExceptionâ€™: The operation did not complete within the allotted timeout of 00:00:10. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.
```

### <a name="common-causes"></a>Common causes
There are two common causes for this error: incorrect configuration, or a transient service error.

1. **Incorrect configuration** The operation timeout might be too small for the operational condition. The default value for the operation timeout in the client SDK is 60 seconds. Check to see if your code has the value set to something too small. Note that the condition of the network and CPU usage can affect the time it takes for a particular operation to complete, so the operation timeout should not be set to a very small value.
2. **Transient service error** Sometimes Relay can experience delays in processing requests; for example, during periods of high traffic. In such cases, you can retry your operation after a delay, until the operation is successful. If the same operation still fails after multiple attempts, please visit the [Azure service status site](https://azure.microsoft.com/status/) to see if there are any known service outages.
