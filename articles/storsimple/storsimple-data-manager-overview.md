## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Microsoft Azure StorSimple is a hybrid cloud storage solution that addresses the complexities of unstructured data commonly associated with file shares. StorSimple uses cloud storage as an extension of the on-premises solution and automatically tiers data across the on-premises storage and cloud storage. Integrated data protection, with local and cloud snapshots, eliminates the need for a sprawling storage infrastructure. Archival and disaster recovery is also seamless with the cloud acting as an offsite location.

The data transformation service that we are introducing in this document, allows you to seamlessly access the StorSimple data in the cloud. This service provides APIs to extract data from StorSimple and present it to other Azure services in formats that can be readily consumed. The formats supported in this preview are Azure blobs and Azure Media Services assets. This transformation enables you to easily wire up services such as Azure Media Services, Azure HDInsight, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure Search to operate data on StorSimple 8000 series on-premises device.

A high-level block diagram illustrating this is shown below.
