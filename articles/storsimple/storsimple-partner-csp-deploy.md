# <a name="deploy-storsimple-virtual-array-for-cloud-solution-provider-program"></a>Deploy StorSimple Virtual Array for Cloud Solution Provider Program

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

StorSimple Virtual Array can be deployed by the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners for their customers. A CSP partner can create a StorSimple Device Manager service. This service can then be used to deploy and manage StorSimple Virtual Array and the associated shares, volumes, and backups.

This article describes how a CSP partner can add a customer or a new subscription to an existing customer and then create a service to deploy a StorSimple Virtual Array in CSP.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:

- You are enrolled under the CSP program.
- You have valid [Partner Center](http://partnercenter.microsoft.com/) login credentials. The credentials enable you to sign in to the Partner portal to add new customers, search for customers, or navigate to a customer account from the Partner dashboard. The CSP can function as a StorSimple administrator on behalf of the customer in the Azure portal.
                             
## <a name="add-a-customer"></a>Add a customer

If you add a customer, a subscription is automatically created. To add a customer (and automatically create a subscription), perform the following steps in the Partner portal.

1. Go to the [Partner Center](http://partnercenter.microsoft.com/) and sign in using your CSP credentials. Click **Dashboard**.

2. In the left-pane, click **Customers**. In the right-pane, click **Add customers**. Enter the details of the customer. Click **Next: Subscriptions** to create a customer subscription.

## <a name="add-a-subscription"></a>Add a subscription

In some instances, you may have an existing customer, and you need to add a subscription. To add a subscription to an existing customer, perform the following steps in the Partner portal.

1. Go to the [Partner Center](http://partnercenter.microsoft.com/) and sign in using your CSP credentials. Click **Dashboard**.

     ![Dashboard in Partner Center](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/storsimple/media/storsimple-partner-csp-deploy/image1.png)
                              
2. In the left-pane, click **Customers**. Find or navigate to the customer you want to add a subscription to. Click the ![Expand check icon](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/storsimple/media/storsimple-partner-csp-deploy/expand_pane_icon.png) icon to expand the row for the company name for your customer. In the details, click **Add subscriptions**.
