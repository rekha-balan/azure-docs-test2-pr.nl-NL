# <a name="advisor-cost-recommendations"></a>Advisor Cost recommendations

Advisor helps you optimize and reduce your overall Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources. You can get cost recommendations from the **Cost** tab on the Advisor dashboard.

Although certain application scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by managing the size and number of your virtual machines. Advisor monitors your virtual machine usage for 14 days and then identifies low-utilization virtual machines. Virtual machines whose CPU utilization is 5 percent or less and network usage is 7 MB or less for four or more days are considered low-utilization virtual machines.

Advisor shows you the estimated cost of continuing to run your virtual machine, so that you can choose to shut it down or resize it.

Advisor identifies SQL server instances that can benefit from creating elastic database pools. Elastic database pools provide a simple, cost-effective solution to manage the performance goals of multiple databases that have varying usage patterns. For more information about Azure elastic pools, see [What is an Azure Elastic pool?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-elastic-pool/).
