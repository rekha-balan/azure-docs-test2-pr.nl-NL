[comment]: <> (MSSedusch still needed? TODO Originally an Azure Virtual Network was bound to an Affinity Group. With that a Virtual Network in Azure got restricted to the Azure Scale Unit that the Affinity Group got assigned to. In the end, this meant the Virtual Network was restricted to the resources available in the Azure Scale Unit. This has since changed and now Azure Virtual Networks can stretch across more than one Azure Scale Unit. However, that requires that Azure Virtual Networks are **NOT** associated with Affinity Groups anymore at creation time. We already mentioned earlier that in opposite to recommendations a year ago, you should **NOT leverage Azure Affinity Groups anymore**.
