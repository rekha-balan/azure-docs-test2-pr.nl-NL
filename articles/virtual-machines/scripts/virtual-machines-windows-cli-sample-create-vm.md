| [az network public-ip create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/public-ip#create) | Creates a public IP address with a static IP address and an associated DNS name. |
| [az network nsg create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nsg#create) | Creates a network security group (NSG), which is a security boundary between the internet and the virtual machine. |
| [az network nic create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nic#create) | Creates a virtual network card and attaches it to the virtual network, subnet, and NSG. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
