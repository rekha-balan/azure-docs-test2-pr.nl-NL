# <a name="vm-restarting-maintenance"></a>VM restarting maintenance

There are few cases where your VMs are rebooted due to planned maintenance to the underlying infrastructure. Being impactful to the availability of your VMs hosted in Azure, the following are now available for you to use:

-   Notification sent at least 30 days before the impact.

-   Visibility to the maintenance windows per each VM.

-   Flexibility and control in setting the exact time for maintenance to impact your VMs.

Maintenance in Microsoft Azure is scheduled in iterations. Initial iterations have smaller scope in order to reduce the risk involved in rolling out new fixes and capabilities. Later iterations may span multiple regions (never from the same region pair). A VM is included in a single maintenance iteration. If an iteration is aborted, remaining VMs are included in another, future, iteration.

The planned maintenance iteration has two phases: Pre-emptive Maintenance Window and a Scheduled-Maintenance Window.

The **Pre-emptive Maintenance Window** provides you with the flexibility to initiate the maintenance on your VMs. By doing so, you can determine when your VMs are impacted, the sequence of the update, and the time between each VM being maintained. You can query each VM to see whether it is planned for maintenance and check the result of your last initiated maintenance request.

The **Scheduled Maintenance Window** is when Azure has scheduled your VMs for the maintenance. During this time window, which follows the pre-emptive maintenance window, you can still query for the maintenance window, but no longer be able to orchestrate the maintenance.

## <a name="availability-considerations-during-planned-maintenance"></a>Availability considerations during planned maintenance 

### <a name="paired-regions"></a>Paired regions

Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, together making a regional pair. When executing maintenance, Azure will only update the Virtual Machine instances in a single region of its pair. For example, when updating the Virtual Machines in North Central US, Azure will not update any Virtual Machines in South Central US at the same time. This will be scheduled at a separate time, enabling failover or load balancing between regions. However, other regions such as North Europe can be under maintenance at the same time as East US.
Read more about [Azure region pairs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions).

### <a name="single-instance-vms-vs-availability-set-or-vm-scale-set"></a>Single instance VMs vs. availability set or VM scale set

When deploying a workload using virtual machines in Azure, you can create the VMs within an availability set in order to provide high availability to your application. This configuration ensures that during either an outage or maintenance events, at least one virtual machine is available.

Within an availability set, individual VMs are spread across up to 20 update domains. During planned maintenance, only a single update domain is impacted at any given time. The order of update domains being impacted may not proceed sequentially during planned maintenance. For single instance VMs (not part of availability set), there is no way to predict or determine which and how many VMs are impacted together.

Virtual machine scale sets are an Azure compute resource that enables you to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs as a single resource.
The scale set provides similar guarantees to an availability set in the form of update domains. 

For more information about configuring your virtual machines for high availability, see [*Manage the availability of your Windows virtual machines*](manage-availability.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

### <a name="scheduled-events"></a>Scheduled events

Azure Metadata Service enables you to discover information about your Virtual Machine hosted in Azure. Scheduled Events, one of the exposed categories, surfaces information regarding upcoming events (for example, reboot) so your application can prepare for them and limit disruption.

For more information about scheduled events, refer to [Azure Metadata Service - Scheduled Events](../virtual-machines-scheduled-events.md).

## <a name="maintenance-discovery-and-notifications"></a>Maintenance discovery and notifications

Maintenance schedule is visible to customers at the level of individual VMs. You can use Azure portal, API, PowerShell, or CLI to query for the pre-emptive and scheduled maintenance windows. In addition, expect to receive a notification (email) in the case where one (or more) of your VMs are impacted during the process.

Both pre-emptive maintenance and scheduled maintenance phases begin with a notification. Expect to receive a single notification per Azure subscription. The notification is sent to the subscriptionâ€™s admin and co-admin by default. You can also configure the audience for the maintenance notification.

### <a name="view-the-maintenance-window-in-the-portal"></a>View the maintenance window in the portal 

You can use the Azure portal and look for VMs scheduled for maintenance.

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal.

2.  Click and open the **Virtual Machines** blade.

3.  Click the **Columns** button to open the list of available columns to choose from

4.  Select and add the **Maintenance Window** columns. VMs that are scheduled for maintenance have the maintenance windows surfaced. Once maintenance is completed or aborted for a, the maintenance window is no longer be presented.

### <a name="query-maintenance-details-using-the-azure-api"></a>Query maintenance details using the Azure API

Use the [get VM information API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/virtualmachines-get) and look for the instance view to discover the maintenance details on an individual VM. The response includes the following elements:

  - isCustomerInitiatedMaintenanceAllowed: Indicates whether you can now initiate pre-emptive redeploy on the VM.

  - preMaintenanceWindowStartTime: The start time of the pre-emptive maintenance window.

  - preMaintenanceWindowEndTime: The end time of the pre-emptive maintenance window. After this time, you will no longer be able to initiate maintenance on this VM.
    
  - maintenanceWindowStartTime: The start time of the scheduled maintenance window when your VM are impacted.

  - maintenanceWindowEndTime: The end time of the scheduled maintenance window.
  
  - lastOperationResultCode: The result of your last Maintenance-Redeploy operation.
 
  - lastOperationMessage:  Message describing the result of your last Maintenance-Redeploy operation.


## <a name="pre-emptive-redeploy"></a>Pre-emptive redeploy

Pre-emptive redeploy action provides the flexibility to control the time when maintenance is applied to your VMs in Azure. Planned maintenance begins with a pre-emptive maintenance window where you can decide on the exact time for each of your VMs to be rebooted. The following are use cases where such a functionality is useful:

-   Maintenance need to be coordinated with the end customer.

-   The scheduled maintenance window offered by Azure is not sufficient.
    It could be that the window happens to be on the busiest time of the week or it is too long.

-   For multi-instance or multi-tier applications, you need sufficient time between two VMs or a certain sequence to follow.

When you call for pre-emptive redeploy on a VM, it moves the VM to an already updated node and then powers it back on, retaining all your configuration options and associated resources. While doing so, the temporary disk is lost and dynamic IP addresses associated with virtual network interface are updated.

Pre-emptive redeploy is enabled once per VM. If there is an error during the process, the operation is aborted, the VM is not impacted and it is excluded from the planned maintenance iteration. You will be contacted in a later time with a new schedule and offered a new opportunity to schedule and sequence the impact on your VMs.
