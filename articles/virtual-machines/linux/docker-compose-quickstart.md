# <a name="get-started-with-docker-and-compose-to-define-and-run-a-multi-container-application-in-azure"></a>Get started with Docker and Compose to define and run a multi-container application in Azure
With [Compose](http://github.com/docker/compose), you use a simple text file to define an application consisting of multiple Docker containers. You then spin up your application in a single command that does everything to deploy your defined environment. As an example, this article shows you how to quickly set up a WordPress blog with a backend MariaDB SQL database on an Ubuntu VM. You can also use Compose to set up more complex applications.

## <a name="step-1-set-up-a-linux-vm-as-a-docker-host"></a>Step 1: Set up a Linux VM as a Docker host
You can use various Azure procedures and available images or Resource Manager templates in the Azure Marketplace to create a Linux VM and set it up as a Docker host. For example, see [Using the Docker VM Extension to deploy your environment](dockerextension.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) to quickly create an Ubuntu VM with the Azure Docker VM extension by using a [quickstart template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu). 

When you use the Docker VM extension, your VM is automatically set up as a Docker host and Compose is already installed. You can create a VM and use the Docker VM extension using one of the following CLI versions:

- [Azure CLI 2.0](#azure-cli-20) - our next generation CLI for the resource management deployment model
- [Azure CLI 1.0](#azure-cli-10) â€“ our CLI for the classic and resource management deployment models

### <a name="azure-cli-20"></a>Azure CLI 2.0
Install the latest [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) and log in to an Azure account using [az login](/cli/azure/#login).

First, create a resource group for your Docker environment with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create). The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `West US` location:

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus
```

Next, deploy a VM with [az group deployment create](/cli/azure/group/deployment#create) that includes the Azure Docker VM extension from [this Azure Resource Manager template on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu). Provide your own values for `newStorageAccountName`, `adminUsername`, `adminPassword`, and `dnsNameForPublicIP`:

```azurecli
az group deployment create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --parameters '{"newStorageAccountName": {"value": "mystorageaccount"},
    "adminUsername": {"value": "azureuser"},
    "adminPassword": {"value": "P@ssw0rd!"},
    "dnsNameForPublicIP": {"value": "mypublicdns"}}' \
  --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu/azuredeploy.json
```

It takes a few minutes for the deployment to finish. Once the deployment is finished, [move to next step](#step-2-verify-that-compose-is-installed) to SSH to your VM. 

Optionally, to instead return control to the prompt and let the deployment continue in the background, add the `--no-wait` flag to the preceding command. This process allows you to perform other work in the CLI while the deployment continues for a few minutes. You can then view details about the Docker host status with [az vm show](/cli/azure/vm#show). The following example checks the status of the VM named `myDockerVM` (the default name from the template - don't change this name) in the resource group named `myResourceGroup`:

```azurecli
az vm show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myDockerVM \
  --query [provisioningState] --output tsv
```

When this command returns `Succeeded`, the deployment has finished and you can SSH to the VM in the following step.

### <a name="azure-cli-10"></a>Azure CLI 1.0
Install the latest [Azure CLI 1.0](../../cli-install-nodejs.md) and log in to an Azure account. Make sure that you are in Resource Manager mode to create the VM (`azure config mode arm`).

The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `West US` location and deploys a VM with the Azure Docker VM extension. An [Azure Resource Manager template from GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu) is used to deploy the environment:

```azurecli
azure group create --name myResourceGroup --location "West US" \
  --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu/azuredeploy.json
```

The Azure CLI returns you to the prompt after only a few seconds, but your Docker host is still being created and configured. It takes a few minutes for the deployment to finish. You can view details about the Docker host status using the `azure vm show` command. The following example checks the status of the VM named `myDockerVM` (the default name from the template - don't change this name) in the resource group named `myResourceGroup`. Enter the name of the resource group you created in the preceding step:

```azurecli
azure vm show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myDockerVM
```

## <a name="step-2-verify-that-compose-is-installed"></a>Step 2: Verify that Compose is installed
Once the deployment is finished, SSH to your new Docker host using the DNS name you provided during deployment. You can use `azure vm show -g myResourceGroup -n myDockerVM` (Azure CLI 1.0) or `az vm show -g myResourceGroup -n myDockerVM -d --query [fqdns] -o tsv` (Azure CLI 2.0) to view details of your VM, including the DNS name.

To check that Compose is installed on the VM, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

You see output similar to `docker-compose 1.6.2, build 4d72027`.

> [!TIP]
> If you used another method to create a Docker host and need to install Compose yourself, see the [Compose documentation](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/882dc673ce84b0b29cd59b6815cb93f74a6c4134/docs/install.md).


## <a name="step-3-create-a-docker-composeyml-configuration-file"></a>Step 3: Create a docker-compose.yml configuration file
Next you create a `docker-compose.yml` file, which is just a text configuration file, to define the Docker containers to run on the VM. The file specifies the image to run on each container (or it could be a build from a Dockerfile), necessary environment variables and dependencies, ports, and the links between containers. For details on yml file syntax, see [Compose file reference](http://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/).

Create the `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```

Use your favorite text editor to add some data to the file. The following example uses the `vi` editor:

```bash
vi docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the following example into your text file. This configuration uses images from the [DockerHub Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/) to install WordPress (the open source blogging and content management system) and a linked backend MariaDB SQL database. Enter your own `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` as follows:

```sh
wordpress:
  image: wordpress
  links:
    - db:mysql
  ports:
    - 80:80

db:
  image: mariadb
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: <your password>
```

## <a name="step-4-start-the-containers-with-compose"></a>Step 4: Start the containers with Compose
In the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file, run the following command (depending on your environment, you might need to run `docker-compose` using `sudo`.):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command starts the Docker containers specified in `docker-compose.yml`. It takes a minute or two for this step to complete. You see output similar to the following example:

```bash
Creating wordpress_db_1...
Creating wordpress_wordpress_1...
...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to use the **-d** option on start-up so that the containers run in the background continuously.


To verify that the containers are up, type `docker-compose ps`. You should see something like:

```bash
Name             Command             State              Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
wordpress_db_1     /docker-           Up                 3306/tcp
             entrypoint.sh
             mysqld
wordpress_wordpr   /entrypoint.sh     Up                 0.0.0.0:80->80
ess_1              apache2-for ...                       /tcp
```

You can now connect to WordPress directly on the VM on port 80. Open a web browser and enter the DNS name of your VM (such as `http://myresourcegroup.westus.cloudapp.azure.com`). You should now see the WordPress start screen, where you can complete the installation and get started with the application.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
* Go to the [Docker VM extension user guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docker-extension/blob/master/README.md) for more options to configure Docker and Compose in your Docker VM. For example, one option is to put the Compose yml file (converted to JSON) directly in the configuration of the Docker VM extension.
* Check out the [Compose command-line reference](http://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) and [user guide](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) for more examples of building and deploying multi-container apps.
* Use an Azure Resource Manager template, either your own or one contributed from the [community](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/), to deploy an Azure VM with Docker and an application set up with Compose. For example, the [Deploy a WordPress blog with Docker](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/docker-wordpress-mysql) template uses Docker and Compose to quickly deploy WordPress with a MySQL backend on an Ubuntu VM.
* Try integrating Docker Compose with a Docker Swarm cluster. See [Using Compose with Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/compose/swarm/) for scenarios.
