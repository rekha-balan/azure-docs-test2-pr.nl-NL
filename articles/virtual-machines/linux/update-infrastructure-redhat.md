# <a name="red-hat-update-infrastructure-rhui-for-on-demand-red-hat-enterprise-linux-vms-in-azure"></a>Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) for on-demand Red Hat Enterprise Linux VMs in Azure
Virtual machines created from the on-demand Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) images available in Azure Marketplace are registered to access the Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) deployed in Azure.  The on-demand RHEL instances have access to a regional yum repository and able to receive incremental updates.

The yum repository list, which is managed by RHUI, is configured in your RHEL instance during provisioning. You don't need to do any additional configuration - run `yum update` after your RHEL instance is ready to get the latest updates.

> [!NOTE]
> In September 2016 we deployed an updated Azure RHUI and in January 2017 we started phased shutdown of the older Azure RHUI. If you have been using the RHEL images (or their snapshots) from September 2016 or later - likely no action is required. If, however, you have older snapshots/VMs, their configuration needs to be updated for uninterrupted access to the Azure RHUI.
> 

## <a name="rhui-azure-infrastructure-update"></a>RHUI Azure Infrastructure Update
As of September 2016, Azure has a new set of Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) servers. These servers are deployed with [Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager/) so that a single endpoint (rhui-1.micrsoft.com) can be used by any VM regardless of region. The new RHEL Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) images in the Azure Marketplace (versions dated September 2016 or later) point to the new Azure RHUI servers and do not require any additional action.

### <a name="determine-if-action-is-required"></a>Determine if action is required
If you are experiencing problems connecting to Azure RHUI from your Azure RHEL PAYG VM, follow these steps
1. Inspect VM configuration for Azure RHUI endpoint

    Check if `/etc/yum.repos.d/rh-cloud.repo` file contains reference to `rhui-[1-3].microsoft.com` in baseurl of `[rhui-microsoft-azure-rhel*]` section of the file. If it is - you are using the new Azure RHUI.

    If it pointing to a location with the following pattern `mirrorlist.*cds[1-4].cloudapp.net` - the configuration update is required.

    If you are using the new configuration and still cannot connect to Azure RHUI - file a support case with Microsoft or Red Hat.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Access to Azure-hosted RHUI is limited to the VMs within [Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653).
    > 

2. If the old Azure RHUI is still available when you do this check and you would like to automatically update the configuration, execute the following command:

    `sudo yum update RHEL6` or `sudo yum update RHEL7` depending on the RHEL family version.

3. If you can no longer connect to the old Azure RHUI, follow the manual steps described in the next section.

4. Make sure to update the configuration on the source image/snapshot affected VM was provisioned from.

### <a name="phased-shutdown-of-the-old-azure-rhui"></a>Phased shutdown of the old Azure RHUI
During the shutdown of the old Azure RHUI we restrict access to it as follows:

1. Further restrict access (ACL) to set of IP addresses that are already connecting to it. Possible side-effects: if you continue using the old Azure RHUI - your new VMs may not be able to connect to it. RHEL VMs with dynamic IPs that go through shutdown/deallocate/start sequence may receive new IP and hence also could start failing to connect to the old Azure RHUI

2. Shutdown of mirror content delivery servers. Possible side-effects: as we shut down more CDSes you may see longer `yum update` servicing time, more timeouts up until the point when you can no longer connect to the old Azure RHUI.

### <a name="the-ips-for-the-new-rhui-content-delivery-servers-are"></a>The IPs for the new RHUI content delivery servers are
If you are using network configuration to further restrict access from RHEL PAYG VMs, make sure the following IPs are allowed for `yum update` to work depending on the environment you are in. 

```

Download (via curl) the public key signature

```bash
curl -o RPM-GPG-KEY-microsoft-azure-release https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/D/9/9d945f05-541d-494f-9977-289b3ce8e774/microsoft-sign-public.asc 
```

Verify the downloaded key

```bash
gpg --list-packets --verbose < RPM-GPG-KEY-microsoft-azure-release
```

Check the output, verify `keyid` and `user ID packet`:

```

Verify:

```bash
rpm -Kv azureclient.rpm
```

Check in output that signature of the package is OK

```bash

## <a name="rhui-overview"></a>RHUI overview
[Red Hat Update Infrastructure](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-update-infrastructure) offers a highly scalable solution to manage yum repository content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux cloud instances that are hosted by Red Hat-certified cloud providers. Based on the upstream Pulp project, RHUI allows cloud providers to locally mirror Red Hat-hosted repository content, create custom repositories with their own content, and make those repositories available to a large group of end users through a load-balanced content delivery system.

## <a name="regions-where-rhui-is-available"></a>Regions where RHUI is available
RHUI is available in all regions where RHEL on-demand images are available. It currently includes all public regions listed on the [Azure status dashboard](https://azure.microsoft.com/status/) page, Azure US Government and Azure Germany regions. RHUI access for VMs provisioned from RHEL on-demand images is included in their price. Additional regional/national cloud availability will be updated as we expand RHEL on-demand availability in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> Access to Azure-hosted RHUI is limited to the VMs within [Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653).
> 
> 

## <a name="get-updates-from-another-update-repository"></a>Get updates from another update repository
If you need to get updates from a different update repository (instead of Azure-hosted RHUI), first you need to unregister your instances from RHUI. Then you need to re-register them with the desired update infrastructure (such as Red Hat Satellite or Red Hat Customer Portal CDN). You will need appropriate Red Hat subscriptions for these services and registration for [Red Hat Cloud Access in Azure](https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/partners/ccsp/microsoft-azure).

To unregister RHUI and reregister to your update infrastructure follow these steps:

1. Edit /etc/yum.repos.d/rh-cloud.repo and change all `enabled=1` to `enabled=0`. For example:
   
   ```bash
   sed -i 's/enabled=1/enabled=0/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/rh-cloud.repo
   ```
   
2. Edit /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf and change `enabled=0` to `enabled=1`.
3. Then register with the desired infrastructure, such as Red Hat Customer Portal. Follow Red Hat solution guide on [how to register and subscribe a system to the Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273).

> [!NOTE]
> Access to the Azure-hosted RHUI is included in the RHEL Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) image price. Unregistering a PAYG RHEL VM from the Azure-hosted RHUI does not convert the virtual machine into Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) type VM. If you register the same VM with another source of updates you may be incurring double charges: first time for Azure RHEL software fee, and the second time for Red Hat subscription(s). 
> 
> If you consistently need to use an update infrastructure other than Azure-hosted RHUI consider creating and deploying your own (BYOL-type) images as described in [Create and Upload Red Hat-based virtual machine for Azure](redhat-create-upload-vhd.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) article.
> 

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
To create a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM from Azure Marketplace Pay-As-You-Go image and leverage Azure-hosted RHUI go to [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/redhat/). You will be able to use `yum update` in your RHEL instance without any additional setup.
