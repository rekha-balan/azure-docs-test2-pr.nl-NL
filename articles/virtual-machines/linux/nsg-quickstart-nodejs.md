# <a name="opening-ports-and-endpoints-to-a-linux-vm-in-azure-using-the-azure-cli-10"></a>Opening ports and endpoints to a Linux VM in Azure using the Azure CLI 1.0
You open a port, or create an endpoint, to a virtual machine (VM) in Azure by creating a network filter on a subnet or VM network interface. You place these filters, which control both inbound and outbound traffic, on a Network Security Group attached to the resource that receives the traffic. Let's use a common example of web traffic on port 80. This article shows you how to open a port to a VM using the Azure CLI 1.0.


## <a name="cli-versions-to-complete-the-task"></a>CLI versions to complete the task
You can complete the task using one of the following CLI versions:

- [Azure CLI 1.0](#quick-commands) â€“ our CLI for the classic and resource management deployment models (this article)
- [Azure CLI 2.0](nsg-quickstart.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) - our next generation CLI for the resource management deployment model


## <a name="quick-commands"></a>Quick commands
To create a Network Security Group and rules you need [the Azure CLI 1.0](../../cli-install-nodejs.md) installed and using Resource Manager mode:

```azurecli
azure config mode arm
```

In the following examples, replace example parameter names with your own values. Example parameter names included `myResourceGroup`, `myNetworkSecurityGroup`, and `myVnet`.

Create your Network Security Group, entering your own names and location appropriately. The following example creates a Network Security Group named `myNetworkSecurityGroup` in the `WestUS` location:

```azurecli
azure network nsg create --resource-group myResourceGroup --location westus \
    --name myNetworkSecurityGroup
```

Add a rule to allow HTTP traffic to your webserver (or adjust for your own scenario, such as SSH access or database connectivity). The following example creates a rule named `myNetworkSecurityGroupRule` to allow TCP traffic on port 80:

```azurecli
azure network nsg rule create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --nsg-name myNetworkSecurityGroup --name myNetworkSecurityGroupRule \
    --protocol tcp --direction inbound --priority 1000 \
    --destination-port-range 80 --access allow
```

Associate the Network Security Group with your VM's network interface (NIC). The following example associates an existing NIC named `myNic` with the Network Security Group named `myNetworkSecurityGroup`:

```azurecli
azure network nic set --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --network-security-group-name myNetworkSecurityGroup --name myNic
```

Alternatively, you can associate your Network Security Group with a virtual network subnet rather than just to the network interface on a single VM. The following example associates an existing subnet named `mySubnet` in the `myVnet` virtual network with the Network Security Group named `myNetworkSecurityGroup`:

```azurecli
azure network vnet subnet set --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --network-security-group-name myNetworkSecurityGroup \
    --vnet-name myVnet --name mySubnet
```

## <a name="more-information-on-network-security-groups"></a>More information on Network Security Groups
The quick commands here allow you to get up and running with traffic flowing to your VM. Network Security Groups provide many great features and granularity for controlling access to your resources. You can read more about [creating a Network Security Group and ACL rules here](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-nsg-arm-cli.md).

You can define Network Security Groups and ACL rules as part of Azure Resource Manager templates. Read more about [creating Network Security Groups with templates](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-nsg-arm-template.md).

If you need to use port-forwarding to map a unique external port to an internal port on your VM, use a load balancer and Network Address Translation (NAT) rules. For example, you may want to expose TCP port 8080 externally and have traffic directed to TCP port 80 on a VM. You can learn about [creating an Internet-facing load balancer](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-get-started-internet-arm-cli.md).

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
In this example, you created a simple rule to allow HTTP traffic. You can find information on creating more detailed environments in the following articles:

* [What is a Network Security Group (NSG)?](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md)
