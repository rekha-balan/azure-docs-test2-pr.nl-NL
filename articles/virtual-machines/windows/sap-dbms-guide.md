[comment]: <> (#### Azure VM backup)
[comment]: <> (VMs within the SAP system can be backed up using Azure Virtual Machine Backup functionality. Azure Virtual Machine Backup got introduced early in the year 2015 and meanwhile is a standard method to backup a complete VM in Azure. Azure Backup stores the backups in Azure and allows a restore of a VM again.)
[comment]: <> (VMs that run databases can be backed up in a consistent manner as well if the DBMS systems supports the Windows VSS Volume Shadow Copy Service <https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb968832.aspx> as SQL Server does. So using Azure VM backup could be a way to get to a restorable backup of a SAP database. However, be aware that based on Azure VM backups point-in-time restores of databases is not possible. Therefore, the recommendation is to perform backups of databases with DBMS functionality instead of relying on Azure VM Backup.)
