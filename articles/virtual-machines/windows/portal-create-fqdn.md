# <a name="create-a-fully-qualified-domain-name-in-the-azure-portal-for-a-windows-vm"></a>Create a Fully Qualified Domain Name in the Azure portal for a Windows VM

When you create a virtual machine (VM) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the Resource Manager deployment model, a public IP resource for the virtual machine is automatically created. You use this IP address to remotely access the VM. Although the portal does not create a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name), or FQDN, by default, you can create one once the VM is created. This article demonstrates the steps to create a DNS name or FQDN.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-portal-create-fqdn](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-portal-create-fqdn.md)]

You can now connect remotely to the VM using this DNS name such as for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

Now that your VM has a public IP and DNS name, you can deploy common application frameworks or services such as IIS, SQL, or SharePoint.

You can also read more about [using Resource Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md) for tips on building your Azure deployments.
