# <a name="planned-maintenance-for-windows-virtual-machines"></a>Planned maintenance for Windows virtual machines 

Microsoft Azure periodically performs updates across the globe to improve the reliability, performance, and security of the host infrastructure that underlies virtual machines. Such updates range from patching software components in the hosting environment (OS, hypervisor and various agents deployed on the host), upgrading networking components, all the way to hardware decommissioning.

The majority of these updates are performed without any impact to hosted virtual machines or cloud services.

However, there are cases where updates do have an impact to hosted virtual machines:

-   VM preserving maintenance using In-place VM migration describes a class of updates where virtual machines are not rebooted during the maintenance.

-   VM restarting maintenance which require a reboot or redeploy to hosted virtual machines.

Please note that this page describes how Microsoft Azure performs planned maintenance. For more information about unplanned events (outages), see [Manage the availability of virtual machines](manage-availability.md).
