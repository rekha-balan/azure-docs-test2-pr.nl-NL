# <a name="create-a-windows-virtual-machine-with-the-azure-portal"></a>Create a Windows virtual machine with the Azure portal

Azure virtual machines can be created through the Azure portal. This method provides a browser-based user interface for creating and configuring virtual machines and all related resources. This Quickstart steps through creating a virtual machine using the Azure portal. Once deployment is complete, we connect to the server and install IIS.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## <a name="log-in-to-azure"></a>Log in to Azure

Log in to the Azure portal at http://portal.azure.com.

## <a name="create-virtual-machine"></a>Create virtual machine

2. Click the **New** button found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

3. Select **Compute** from the **New** blade, select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter** from the **Compute** blade, and then click the **Create** button.

4. Fill out the virtual machine **Basics** form. The user name and password entered here is used to log in to the virtual machine. For **Resource group**, create a new one. A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are created and collectively managed. When complete, click **OK**.

    ![Enter basic information about your VM in the portal blade](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/virtual-machines/windows/media/quick-create-portal/create-windows-vm-portal-basic-blade.png)  

5. Choose a size for the VM. To see more sizes, select **View all** or change the **Supported disk type** filter. 

    ![Screenshot that shows VM sizes](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/virtual-machines/windows/media/quick-create-portal/create-windows-vm-portal-sizes.png)  

6. On the settings blade, select **Yes** under **Use managed disks**, keep the defaults for the rest of the settings, and click **OK**.

7. On the summary page, click **Ok** to start the virtual machine deployment.

8. To monitor deployment status, click the virtual machine. The VM can be found on the Azure portal dashboard, or by selecting **Virtual Machines** from the left-hand menu. When the VM has been created, the status changes from **Deploying** to **Running**.

## <a name="open-port-80-for-web-traffic"></a>Open port 80 for web traffic 

To allow traffic for IIS, you need to open port 80 to web traffic. This step walks you through creating a network security group (NSG) rule to allow inbound connections on port 80.

1. On the blade for the virtual machine, in the **Essentials** section, click the name of the **Resource group**.
2. In the blade for the resource group, click the **Network security group** in the list of resources. The NSG name should be the VM name with -nsg appended to the end.
3. Click the **Inbound Security Rule** heading to open the list of inbound rules. You should see a rule for RDP already in the list.
4. Click **+ Add** to open the **Add inbound security rule** blade.
5. In **Name**, type **IIS**. Make sure **Port range** is set to 80 and **Action** is set to **Allow**. Click **OK**.


## <a name="connect-to-virtual-machine"></a>Connect to virtual machine

After the deployment has completed, create a remote desktop connection to the virtual machine.

1. Click the **Connect** button on the virtual machine blade. A Remote Desktop Protocol file (.rdp file) is created and downloaded.

    ![Portal 9](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/virtual-machines/windows/media/quick-create-portal/quick-create-portal/portal-quick-start-9.png) 

2. To connect to your VM, open the downloaded RDP file. If prompted, click **Connect**. On a Mac, you need an RDP client such as this [Remote Desktop Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

3. Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the virtual machine, then click **Ok**.

4. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click **Yes** or **Continue** to proceed with the connection.


## <a name="install-iis-using-powershell"></a>Install IIS using PowerShell

On the virtual machine, open a PowerShell prompt and run the following command to install IIS and enable the local firewall rule to allow web traffic:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
```

## <a name="view-the-iis-welcome-page"></a>View the IIS welcome page

With IIS installed and port 80 now open on your VM from the Internet, you can use a web browser of your choice to view the default IIS welcome page. Get the **Public IP address** from the blade for the VM and use it to visit the default web page. 

![IIS default site](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/virtual-machines/windows/media/quick-create-powershell/default-iis-website.png) 

## <a name="delete-virtual-machine"></a>Delete virtual machine

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group from the virtual machine blade and click **Delete**.
