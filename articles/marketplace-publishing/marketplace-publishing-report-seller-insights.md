# <a name="understand-your-seller-insights-report"></a>Understand your seller insights report
**What are seller insights?**

All VM and usage-based billing developer services publishers receive monthly reports from Microsoft, if their offers are generating usage.

**What will I receive?**

* **Welcome email:** As a new publisher, you will receive a welcome email to notify you that you will begin receiving the seller insights monthly reports.
* **Monthly sales reports:**  If you have usage, you will receive a second email that contains your reports and instructions on how to access your password:

  * If you have a VM or usage-based billing developer services SKU that is generating usage, your monthly report will show you details about the orders, usage, markets, and customer details for your offers.
  * Reports are locked with a password that only you and Microsoft know in order to protect your customersâ€™ data.
  * Microsoft will not send a report if none of your offers have generated usage during the month.
