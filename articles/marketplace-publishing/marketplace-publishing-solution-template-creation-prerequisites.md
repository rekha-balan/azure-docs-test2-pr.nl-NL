Read the process thoroughly before beginning and understand where and why each step is performed. As much as possible, you should prepare your company information and other data, download necessary tools, and/or create technical components before beginning the offer creation process.  

## <a name="developing-building-blocks"></a>Developing building blocks
You must decide on the building blocks of your solution before you proceed with your solution template on the Publishing Portal. Below are some links to the documents that can help you in the process:

1. [Best practices for designing Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/best-practices-resource-manager-design-templates.md)
2. [Authoring Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates.md)
3. Azure Quickstart templates:
   * [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/templates/](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/)
   * [https://github.com/azure/azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/azure/azure-quickstart-templates)

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
Now that you have reviewed the prerequisites and completed the necessary tasks, you can move forward with creating your solution template offer as detailed in the [Guide to creating a solution template](marketplace-publishing-solution-template-creation.md). To return to the main page of publisher tasks, see [Getting started: How to publish an offer to the Azure Marketplace](marketplace-publishing-getting-started.md).
