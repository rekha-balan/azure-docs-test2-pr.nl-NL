title: Data replication in Azure Storage | Microsoft Docs
description: Data in your Microsoft Azure storage account is replicated for durability and high availability. Replication options include locally redundant storage (LRS), zone-redundant storage (ZRS), geo-redundant storage (GRS), and read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS).
