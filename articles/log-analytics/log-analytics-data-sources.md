# <a name="data-sources-in-log-analytics"></a>Data sources in Log Analytics
Log Analytics collects data from the Connected Sources in your OMS workspace and stores it in OMS repository.  The data that is collected from each is defined by the Data Sources that you configure.  Data in the OMS repository is stored as a set of records.  Each data source creates records of a particular type with each type having its own set of properties.

Data Sources are different than OMS Solutions which also collect data from Connected Sources and create records in the OMS repository.  Solutions can be added to your workspace from the Solutions Gallery and will typically provide additional analysis tools in the OMS portal.  

## <a name="summary-of-data-sources"></a>Summary of data sources
The data sources that are currently available in Log Analytics are listed in the following table.  Each has a link to a separate article providing detail for that data source.

| Data Source | Event Type | Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| [Custom logs](log-analytics-data-sources-custom-logs.md) |\<LogName\>_CL |Text files on Windows or Linux agents containing log information. |
| [Windows Event logs](log-analytics-data-sources-windows-events.md) |Event |Events collected from the event log on Windows computers. |
| [Windows Performance counters](log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters.md) |Perf |Performance counters collected from Windows computers. |
| [Linux Performance counters](log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters.md) |Perf |Performance counters collected from Linux computers. |
| [IIS logs](log-analytics-data-sources-iis-logs.md) |W3CIISLog |Internet Information Services logs in W3C format. |
| [Syslog](log-analytics-data-sources-syslog.md) |Syslog |Syslog events on Windows or Linux computers. |

## <a name="configuring-data-sources"></a>Configuring data sources
You configure data sources from the **Data** menu in Log Analytics **Settings**.  Any configuration is delivered to all connected sources in your OMS workspace.  You cannot currently exclude any agents from this configuration.

![Configure Windows events](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-data-sources/configure-events.png)

1. In the OMS console select the **Settings** tile.
2. Select **Data**.
3. Click on the data source to configure.
4. Follow the link to the documentation for each data source in the above table for details on their configuration.

## <a name="data-collection"></a>Data collection
Data source configurations are delivered to agents that are directly connected to Log Analytics within a few minutes.  The specified data is collected from the agent and delivered directly to Log Analytics at intervals specific to each data source.  See the documentation for each data source for these specifics.

For System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) agents in a connected management group, data source configurations are translated into management packs and delivered to the management group every 5 minutes by default.  The agent downloads the management pack like any other and collects the specified data. Depending on the data source the data will be either sent to a management server which forwards the data to the Log Analytics, or the agent will send the data to Log Analytics without going through the management server. Refer to [data collection details for OMS features and solutions](log-analytics-add-solutions.md#data-collection-details) for details.  You can read about details of connecting SCOM and OMS and modifying the frequency that configuration is delivered at [Configure Integration with System Center Operations Manager](log-analytics-om-agents.md).

If the agent is unable to connect to Log Analytics or Operations Manager, it will continue to collect data that it will deliver when it establishes a connection.  Data can be lost if the amount of data reaches the maximum cache size for the client, or if the agent is not able to establish a connection within 24 hours.

## <a name="log-analytics-records"></a>Log Analytics records
All data collected by Log Analytics is stored in the OMS repository as records.  Records collected by different data sources will have their own set of properties and be identified by their **Type** property.  See the documentation for each data source and solution for details on each record type.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next Steps
* Learn about [solutions](log-analytics-add-solutions.md) that add functionality to Log Analytics and also collect data into the OMS repository.
* Learn about [log searches](log-analytics-log-searches.md) to analyze the data collected from data sources and solutions.  
* Configure [alerts](log-analytics-alerts.md) to proactively notify you of critical data collected from data sources and solutions.
