# <a name="track-software-changes-in-your-environment-with-the-change-tracking-solution"></a>Track software changes in your environment with the Change Tracking solution

This article helps you use the Change Tracking solution in Log Analytics to easily identify changes in your environment. The solution tracks changes to Windows and Linux software, Windows files and registry keys, Windows services, and Linux daemons. Identifying configuration changes can help you pinpoint operational issues.

You install the solution to update the type of agent that you have installed. Changes to installed software, Windows services, and Linux daemons on the monitored servers are read and then the data is sent to the Log Analytics service in the cloud for processing. Logic is applied to the received data and the cloud service records the data. By using the information on the Change Tracking dashboard, you can easily see the changes that were made in your server infrastructure.

## <a name="installing-and-configuring-the-solution"></a>Installing and configuring the solution
Use the following information to install and configure the solution.

* You must have a [Windows](log-analytics-windows-agents.md), [Operations Manager](log-analytics-om-agents.md), or [Linux](log-analytics-linux-agents.md) agent on each computer where you want to monitor changes.
* Add the Change Tracking solution to your OMS workspace from the [Azure marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/Microsoft.ChangeTrackingOMS?tab=Overview) or by using the process described in [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](log-analytics-add-solutions.md).  There is no further configuration required.

### <a name="configure-windows-files-to-track"></a>Configure Windows files to track
Use the following steps to configure files to track on Windows computers.

1. In the OMS portal, click **Settings** (the gear symbol).
2. On the **Settings** page, click **Data**, and then click **Windows File Tracking**.
3. Under Windows File Change Tracking, type the entire path, including the file name of the file that you want to track and then click the **Add** symbol. For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.
4. Click **Save**.

### <a name="configure-windows-registry-keys-to-track"></a>Configure Windows registry keys to track
Use the following steps to configure registry keys to track on Windows computers.

1. In the OMS portal, click **Settings** (the gear symbol).
2. On the **Settings** page, click **Data**, and then click **Windows Registry Tracking**.
3. Under Windows Registry Change Tracking, type the entire key that you want to track and then click the **Add** symbol.
4. Click **Save**.

### <a name="limitations"></a>Limitations
The Change Tracking solution does not currently support the following:

* folders (directories)
* recursion
* wild cards
* path variables
* network file systems

Other limitations:

* The **Max File Size** column and values are unused in the current implementation.
* If you collect more than 2500 files in the 30-minute collection cycle, solution performance might be degraded.
* When network traffic is high, change records may take up to a maximum of six hours to display.
* If you modify the configuration while a computer is shut down, the computer might post file changes that belonged to the previous configuration.

## <a name="change-tracking-data-collection-details"></a>Change Tracking data collection details
Change Tracking collects software inventory and Windows Service metadata using the agents that you have enabled.

The following table shows data collection methods and other details about how data is collected for Change Tracking.

| platform | Direct Agent | SCOM agent | Linux agent | Azure Storage | SCOM required? | SCOM agent data sent via management group | collection frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows and Linux |![Yes](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-green.png) |![Yes](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-green.png) |![Yes](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-green.png) |![No](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-red.png) |![No](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-red.png) |![Yes](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-green.png) | 5 minutes to 50 minutes, depending on the change type. See below for more information. |


The following table shows the data collection frequency for the types of changes.

| **change type** | **frequency** | **Does**  **agent**  **send differences when found?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows registry | 50 minutes | No |
| Windows file | 30 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |
| Linux file | 15 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |
| Windows services | 30 minutes | Yes, every 30 minutes when changes are found. Every 24 hours a snapshot is sent, regardless of change. So, the snapshot is sent even where there are no changes. |
| Linux daemons | 5 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |
| Windows software | 30 minutes | Yes, every 30 minutes when changes are found. Every 24 hours a snapshot is sent, regardless of change. So, the snapshot is sent even where there are no changes. |
| Linux software | 5 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |

## <a name="use-change-tracking"></a>Use Change Tracking
After the solution is installed, you can view the summary of changes for your monitored servers by using the **Change Tracking** tile on the **Overview** page in OMS.

![image of Change Tracking tile](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-change-tracking/change-tracking-tile.png)

You can view changes to your infrastructure and then drill-into details for the following categories:

* Changes by configuration type for software and Windows services
* Software changes to applications and updates for individual servers
* Total number of software changes for each application
* Linux packages
* Windows service changes for individual servers
* Linux daemon changes
