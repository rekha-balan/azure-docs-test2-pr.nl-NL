# <a name="create-an-alert-webhook-action-in-oms-log-analytics-to-send-message-to-slack"></a>Create an alert webhook action in OMS Log Analytics to send message to Slack
One of the actions you can run in response to a [Log Analytics alert](log-analytics-alerts.md) is a *webhook*, which allows you to invoke an external process through a single HTTP request.  You can read about details of alerts and webhooks in [Alerts in Log Analytics](log-analytics-alerts.md)

In this article, weâ€™ll walk through an example of creating a webhook action in a Log Analytics alert using Slack which is a messaging service.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a Slack account to complete this sample.  You can sign up for a free account at [slack.com](http://slack.com).

## <a name="step-1---enable-webhooks-in-slack"></a>Step 1 - Enable webhooks in Slack
1. Sign in to Slack at [slack.com](http://slack.com).
2. Select a channel in the **Channels** section in the left pane.  This is the channel that the message will be sent to.  You can select one of the default channels such as **general** or **random**.  In a production scenario, you would most likely create a special channel such as **criticalservicealerts**. <br>
   
   ![Slack channels](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-alerts-webhooks/oms-webhooks01.png)
3. Click **Add an app or custom integration** to open the App Directory.
4. Type *webhooks* into the search box and then select **Incoming WebHooks**. <br>
   
   ![Slack channels](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-alerts-webhooks/oms-webhooks02.png)
5. Click **Install** next to your team name.
6. Click **Add Configuration**.
7. Select the the channel that you're going to use for this example, and then click **Add Incoming WebHooks integration**.  
8. Copy the **Webhook URL**.  You'll be pasting this into the Alert configuration. <br>

## <a name="step-2---create-alert-rule-in-log-analytics"></a>Step 2 - Create alert rule in Log Analytics
1. [Create an alert rule](log-analytics-alerts.md) with the following settings.
   * Query: ```    Type=Event EventLevelName=error ```
   * Check for this alert every: 5 minutes
   * The number of results is: greater than 10
   * Over this time window: 60 minutes
   * Select **Yes** for **Webhook** and **No** for the other actions.
2. Paste the Slack URL into the **Webhook URL** field.
3. Select the option to **include a custom JSON payload**.
4. Slack expects a payload formatted in JSON with a parameter named *text*.  This is the text that it will display in the message it creates.  You can use one or more of the alert parameters using the *#* symbol such as in the following example.
   
    ```
    {
    "text":"#alertrulename fired with #searchresultcount records which exceeds the over threshold of #thresholdvalue ."
    }
    ```
   
    ![example JSON payload](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/log-analytics/media/log-analytics-alerts-webhooks/oms-webhooks07.png)
5. Click **Save** to save the alert rule.
6. Wait sufficient time for an alert to be created and then check Slack for a message which will be similar to the following.

### <a name="advanced-webhook-payload-for-slack"></a>Advanced webhook payload for Slack
You can extensively customize inbound messages with Slack. For more information, see [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) on the Slack website. Following is a more complex payload to create a rich message with formatting:

    {
        "attachments": [
            {
                "title":"OMS Alerts Custom Payload",
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "title": "Alert Rule Name",
                        "value": "#alertrulename"},
                    {
                        "title": "Link To SearchResults",
                        "value": "<#linktosearchresults|OMS Search Results>"},
                    {
                        "title": "Search Interval",
                        "value": "#searchinterval"},
                    {
                        "title": "Threshold Operator",
                        "value": "#thresholdoperator"},
                    {
                        "title": "Threshold Value",
                        "value": "#thresholdvalue"}
                ],
                "color": "#F35A00"
            }
        ]
    }


This would generate a message in Slack similar to the following.

## <a name="summary"></a>Summary
With this alert rule in place, you would have a message sent to Slack every time the criteria is met.  

This is only one example of an action that you can create in response to an alert.  You could create a webhook action that calls another external service, a runbook action to start a runbook in Azure Automation, or an email action to send a mail to yourself or other recipients.
