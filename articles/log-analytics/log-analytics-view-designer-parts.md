# <a name="log-analytics-view-designer-visualization-part-reference"></a>Log Analytics View Designer visualization part reference
The View Designer in Log Analytics allows you to create custom views in the OMS console that contain different visualizations of data from the OMS repository. This article provides a reference of the settings for each of the visualization parts available to use in your custom views.

Other articles available for View Designer are:

* [View Designer](log-analytics-view-designer.md) - Overview of the View Designer and procedures for creating and editing custom views.
* [Tile reference](log-analytics-view-designer-tiles.md) - Reference of the settings for each of the tiles available to use in your custom views. 

The following table describes the different types of tiles available in the View Designer.  The sections below describe each tile type in detail and their properties.

## <a name="common-settings"></a>Common settings
The following sections describe settings common to several visualization parts.

### <a name="name-value-separator">Name & Value Separator</a>
Single character delimiter if you want to parse the text property from a list query into multiple values.  If you specify a delimiter, you can provide names for each field separated by the same delimiter in the Name box.

For example, consider a property called *Location* that included values such as *Redmond-Building 41* and *Bellevue-Building12*.  You could specify – for the Name & Value Separator and *City-Building* for the Name.  This would parse each value into two properties called *City* and *Building*. 

### <a name="navigation-query">Navigation query</a>
Query to run when the user selects an item in the list.  Use *{selected item}* to include the syntax for item that the user selected.

For example, if the query has a column called *Computer* and the navigation query is *{selected item}*, a query such as *Computer="MyComputer"* would be run when the user selected a computer.  If the navigation query is *Type=Event {selected item}* then the query *Type=Event Computer="MyComputer"* would be run.

### <a name="sparklines">Sparklines</a>
A sparkline is a small line chart that illustrates the value of a list entry over time.  For visualization parts with a list, you can select whether to display a horizontal bar indicating the relative value of a numeric column or a sparkline indicating its value over time.

The following table describes the settings for sparklines.

| Setting | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Enable Sparklines |Select to display sparkline instead of horizontal bar. |
| Operation |If sparklines are enabled, this is the operation to perform on each property in the list to calculate the values for the sparkline.<br><br>- Last Sample: Last value for the series over the time interval.<br>- Max: Maximum value for the series over the time interval.<br>- Min: Minimum value for the series over the time interval.<br>- Sum: Sum of values for the series over the time interval.<br>- Summary: Uses the same measure command as the query in the header. |

### <a name="thresholds">Thresholds</a>
Thresholds allow you to display a colored icon next to each item in a list giving you a quick visual indicator of items that exceed a particular value or fall within a particular range.  For example, you could display a green icon for items with an acceptable value, yellow if the value is within a range that indicates a warning, and red if it exceeds an error value.

When you enable thresholds for a part, you must specify one or more thresholds.  If the value of an item is greater than a threshold value and lower than the next threshold value, then that color is used.  If the item is greater than then highest threshold value, then that color is set.   

Each threshold set has one threshold with a value of **Default**.  This is the color set if no other values are exceeded.  You can add or remove thresholds by clicking the **+** or **x** button.

The following table describes the settings for tresholds.

| Setting | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Enable Thresholds |Select to display a color icon to the left of each value indicating its health relative to specified thresholds. |
| Name |Name to identify the threshold value. |
| Threshold |Value for the threshold.  The health color for each list item is set to the color of the highest threshold value exceeded by the item's value.  There is one Default threshold that is the color if no threshold values are exceeded. |
| Color |Color for the threshold value. |
