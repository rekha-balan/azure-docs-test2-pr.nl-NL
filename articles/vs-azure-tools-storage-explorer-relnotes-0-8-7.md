### <a name="new-updates"></a>New updates
* You can choose how to resolve conflicts at the beginning of an update, download, or copy session in the **Activities** window.
* Hover over a tab to see the full path of the storage resource.
* When you click a tab, it synchronizes with its location in the left side navigation pane.

### <a name="fixes"></a>Fixes
* Fixed: Storage Explorer is now a trusted app on macOS.
* Fixed: Ubuntu 14.04 is again supported.
* Fixed: Sometimes the Add Account UI flashes when loading subscriptions.
* Fixed: Sometimes not all storage resources were listed in the left-side navigation pane.
* Fixed: The action pane sometimes displayed empty actions.
* Fixed: The window size from the last closed session is now retained.
* Fixed: You can open multiple tabs for the same resource using the context menu.

### <a name="known-issues"></a>Known Issues
* Quick Access works only with subscription-based items. Local resources or resources attached via key or SAS token are not supported in this release.
* It may take Quick Access a few seconds to navigate to the target resource, depending on how many resources you have.
* Having more than three groups of blobs or files uploading at the same time may cause errors.
* Search handles searching across roughly 50,000 nodes - after this, performance may be impacted or may cause unhandled exceptions.
* For the first time using the Storage Explorer on macOS, you might see multiple prompts asking for user's permission to access the keychain. We suggest you select **Always Allow** so the prompt doesn't display again
