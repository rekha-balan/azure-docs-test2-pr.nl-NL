# <a name="resolve-past-due-balance-for-your-azure-subscription"></a>Resolve past due balance for your Azure subscription 
If your payment isn't received or we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see an alert in the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com) or the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). If you aren't getting billing notifications in email and you're the Account Administrator, [check the email address in Azure Account Administrator's profile](billing-how-to-change-azure-account-profile.md). We recommend that you use an email address that you check regularly.

If we can't process your payment, you might receive an email with a message like:

**We have been unable to charge your credit card for your subscription. To prevent any service interruptions, please update your payment information.**

## <a name="if-you-forget-to-pay-what-happens"></a>If you forget to pay, what happens?
The service is canceled and your resources are no longer available. Your Azure data is deleted 90 days after the service is terminated.

## <a name="how-to-resolve-the-issue"></a>How to resolve the issue
Pay your outstanding balance in full.

* If you are on an invoice mode of payment, send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice. If you need help, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

* If the credit card on file is declined or expired, [change the credit card used to pay for the subscription](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md) or contact your bank to resolve the issue. When you update the payment method, Azure immediately processes the payment for all outstanding charges. Payment is also processed for any other Microsoft services where you have outstanding charges.

* If you didn't see a bill because the Account Administrator has left the company or changed roles, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to resolve the issue.

If you know your payment has been processed but your subscription is still disabled, see [Reactivate disabled Azure subscription](billing-subscription-become-disable.md).

## <a name="need-help-contact-support"></a>Need help? Contact support.
If you still need help, [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to get your issue resolved quickly.
