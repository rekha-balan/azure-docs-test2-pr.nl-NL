# <a name="cancel-your-subscription-for-azure"></a>Cancel your subscription for Azure
You can cancel your Azure subscription as the [Account Administrator](billing-subscription-transfer.md#whoisaa). After you cancel the subscription, your access to Azure services and resources ends.

Before you cancel your subscription:

* Back up your data. For example, if you're storing data in Azure storage or SQL, download a copy. If you have a virtual machine, save an image of it locally.
* Shut down your services. Go to the [resources page in the management portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?flight=1#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Resources%2Fresources), and **Stop** any running virtual machines, applications, or other services.
* Consider migrating your data. See [Move resources to new resource group or subscription](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources.md).

If you cancel a paid [Azure Support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/), you are still billed monthly for the rest of the 6-months term.

## <a name="what-happens-after-you-cancel-your-subscription"></a>What happens after you cancel your subscription?
It can take up to 10 minutes for the cancellation to be reflected in the portal but billing is stopped immediately.

After you cancel your subscription, we wait 90 days before permanently deleting your data in case you need to access it or you change your mind. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center - How we manage your data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=822930&clcid=0x409).

## <a name="reactivate-subscription"></a>Reactivate subscription
If you canceled your Pay-As-You-Go subscription accidentally, you can [reactivate it in the Accounts Center](billing-subscription-become-disable.md).

## <a name="need-help-contact-support"></a>Need help? Contact support.
If you still have questions, [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to get your issue resolved quickly.
