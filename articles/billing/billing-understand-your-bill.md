# <a name="understand-your-bill-for-microsoft-azure"></a>Understand your bill for Microsoft Azure
To understand your Azure bill, review the invoice with the summary of charges and the separate detailed daily usage file. This article describes most of the terms shown in the invoice and the daily usage file. To get these files, see [How to get your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md). If you're using a free trial subscription, you can get your daily usage information but you don't have an invoice.

The charges for Microsoft Azure subscriptions vary by rate plan. Some rate plans, like the Visual Studio Enterprise (MPN) subscribers, include monthly credits that you can use on any Azure service based on your needs.

Up to 24 hours of usage at the end of the previous billing period may show up in your current bill. Also charges listed on billing statements for international customers are for estimation purposes only. Banks have different costs for the conversion rates.

## <a name="pdf"></a> Understand your invoice (.pdf)
The invoice provides a summary of your charges. It’s available for download in the Portable Document Format (.pdf) from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For more information, see [How to get your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md). 

The following sections list most of the terms that you see on your invoice and descriptions for each term.

### <a name="account-information"></a>Account information
