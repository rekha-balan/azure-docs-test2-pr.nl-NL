# <a name="process-iot-hub-device-to-cloud-messages-using-routes-net"></a>Process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages using routes (.NET)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-process-d2c](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-process-d2c.md)]

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of devices and a solution back end. Other tutorials ([Get started with IoT Hub] and [Send cloud-to-device messages with IoT Hub][lnk-c2d]) show you how to use the basic device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging functionality of IoT Hub.

This tutorial builds on the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial, and shows you how to use routing rules to dispatch device-to-cloud messages in an easy, configuration-based way. The tutorial illustrates how to isolate messages that require immediate action from the solution back end for further processing. For example, a device might send an alarm message that triggers inserting a ticket into a CRM system. By contrast, data-point messages simply feed into an analytics engine. For example, temperature telemetry from a device that is to be stored for later analysis is a data-point message.

At the end of this tutorial, you run three .NET console apps:

* **SimulatedDevice**, a modified version of the app created in the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial, sends data-point device-to-cloud messages every second, and interactive device-to-cloud messages every 10 seconds. This app uses the AMQP protocol to communicate with IoT Hub.
* **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages** that displays the non-critical telemetry sent by your simulated device app.
* **ReadCriticalQueue** de-queues the critical messages sent by your simulated device app from the Service Bus queue attached to the IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub has SDK support for many device platforms and languages, including C, Java, and JavaScript. To learn how to replace the simulated device in this tutorial with a physical device, and how to connect devices to an IoT Hub, see the [Azure IoT Developer Center].
> 
> 

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
* An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in just a couple of minutes.

You should have some basic knowledge of [Azure Storage] and [Azure Service Bus].

## <a name="send-interactive-messages-from-a-simulated-device-app"></a>Send interactive messages from a simulated device app
In this section, you modify the simulated device app you created in the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial to occasionally send messages that require immediate processing.

In Visual Studio, in the **SimulatedDevice** project, replace the `SendDeviceToCloudMessagesAsync` method with the following code:

```
private static async void SendDeviceToCloudMessagesAsync()
{
    double minTemperature = 20;
    double minHumidity = 60;
    Random rand = new Random();

    while (true)
    {
        double currentTemperature = minTemperature + rand.NextDouble() * 15;
        double currentHumidity = minHumidity + rand.NextDouble() * 20;

        var telemetryDataPoint = new
        {
            deviceId = "myFirstDevice",
            temperature = currentTemperature,
            humidity = currentHumidity
        };
        var messageString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(telemetryDataPoint);
        string levelValue;

        if (rand.NextDouble() > 0.7)
        {
            messageString = "This is a critical message";
            levelValue = "critical";
        }
        else
        {
            levelValue = "normal";
        }
        
        var message = new Message(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(messageString));
        message.Properties.Add("level", levelValue);
        
        await deviceClient.SendEventAsync(message);
        Console.WriteLine("{0} > Sent message: {1}", DateTime.Now, messageString);

        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

This method randomly adds the property `"level": "critical"` to messages sent by the device, which simulates a message that requires immediate action by the solution back-end. The device app passes this information in the message properties, instead of in the message body, so that IoT Hub can route the message to the proper message destination.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use message properties to route messages for various scenarios including cold-path processing, in addition to the hot-path example shown here.

> [!NOTE]
> For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement a retry policy such as exponential backoff, as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling].

## <a name="add-a-queue-to-your-iot-hub-and-route-messages-to-it"></a>Add a queue to your IoT hub and route messages to it
In this section, you:

* Create a Service Bus queue.
* Connect it to your IoT hub.
* Configure your IoT hub to send messages to the queue based on the presence of a property on the message.

For more information about how to process messages from Service Bus queues, see [Get started with queues][Service Bus queue].

1. Create a Service Bus queue as described in [Get started with queues][Service Bus queue]. The queue must be in the same subscription and region as your IoT hub. Make a note of the namespace and queue name.

2. In the Azure portal, open your IoT hub and click **Endpoints**.
    
    ![Endpoints in IoT hub][30]

3. In the **Endpoints** blade, click **Add** at the top to add your queue to your IoT hub. Name the endpoint **CriticalQueue** and use the drop-downs to select **Service Bus queue**, the Service Bus namespace in which your queue resides, and the name of your queue. When you are done, click **Save** at the bottom.
    
    ![Adding an endpoint][31]
    
4. Now click **Routes** in your IoT Hub. Click **Add** at the top of the blade to create a routing rule that routes messages to the queue you just added. Select **DeviceTelemetry** as the source of data. Enter `level="critical"` as the condition, and choose the queue you just added as a custom endpoint as the routing rule endpoint. When you are done, click **Save** at the bottom.
    
    ![Adding a route][32]
    
    Make sure the fallback route is set to **ON**. This value is the default configuration for an IoT hub.
    
    ![Fallback route][33]

## <a name="read-from-the-queue-endpoint"></a>Read from the queue endpoint
In this section, you read the messages from the queue endpoint.

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution, by using the **Console App (.NET Framework)** project template. Name the project **ReadCriticalQueue**.

2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ReadCriticalQueue** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**. This operation displays the **NuGet Package Manager** window.

3. Search for **WindowsAzure.ServiceBus**, click **Install**, and accept the terms of use. This operation downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the Azure Service Bus, with all its dependencies.

4. Add the following **using** statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
    ```
    using System.IO;
    using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;
    ```

5. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method. Substitute the connection string with **Listen** permissions for the queue:
   
    ```
    Console.WriteLine("Receive critical messages. Ctrl-C to exit.\n");
    var connectionString = "{service bus listen string}";
    var queueName = "{queue name}";
    
    var client = QueueClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, queueName);

    client.OnMessage(message =>
        {
            Stream stream = message.GetBody<Stream>();
            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream, Encoding.ASCII);
            string s = reader.ReadToEnd();
            Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Message body: {0}", s));
        });
        
    Console.ReadLine();
    ```

## <a name="run-the-applications"></a>Run the applications
Now you are ready to run the applications.

1. In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, right-click your solution and select **Set StartUp Projects**. Select **Multiple startup projects**, then select **Start** as the action for the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages**, **SimulatedDevice**, and **ReadCriticalQueue** projects.
2. Press **F5** to start the three console apps. The **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages** app has only non-critical messages sent from the **SimulatedDevice** application, and the **ReadCriticalQueue** app has only critical messages.
   
   ![Three console apps][50]
