[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-schedule-jobs](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-schedule-jobs.md)]

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables a back-end app to create and track jobs that schedule and update millions of devices.  Jobs can be used for the following actions:

* Update desired properties
* Update tags
* Invoke direct methods

Conceptually, a job wraps one of these actions and tracks the progress of execution against a set of devices, which is defined by a device twin query.  For example, a back-end app can use a job to invoke a reboot method on 10,000 devices, specified by a device twin query and scheduled at a future time.  It can then track progress as each of those devices receive and execute the reboot method.

Learn more about each of these capabilities in these articles:

* Device twin and properties: [Get started with device twins][lnk-get-started-twin] and [Tutorial: How to use device twin properties][lnk-twin-props]
* Direct methods: [IoT Hub developer guide - direct methods][lnk-dev-methods] and [Tutorial: Use direct methods][lnk-c2d-methods]

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Create a simulated device app that has a direct method which enables **lockDoor** which can be called by the back-end app.
* Create a .NET console app that calls the **lockDoor** direct method in the simulated device app using a job and updates the desired properties using a device job.

At the end of this tutorial, you have a Node.js console device app and a .NET (C#) console back-end app:

**simDevice.js**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity and receives a **lockDoor** direct method.

**ScheduleJob**, which calls a direct method in the simulated device app and updates the device twin's desired properties using a job.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
* Node.js version 0.12.x or later. The article [Prepare your development environment][lnk-dev-setup] describes how to install Node.js for this tutorial on either Windows or Linux.
* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.

## <a name="schedule-jobs-for-calling-a-direct-method-and-updating-a-device-twins-properties"></a>Schedule jobs for calling a direct method and updating a device twin's properties
In this section, you create a .NET console app (using C#) that initiates a remote **lockDoor** on a device using a direct method and update the device twin's properties.

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution by using the **Console Application** project template. Name the project **ScheduleJob**.

    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project][img-createapp]

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ScheduleJob** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages...**.
1. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, select **Browse**, search for **microsoft.azure.devices**, select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** package, and accept the terms of use. This step downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT service SDK][lnk-nuget-service-sdk] NuGet package and its dependencies.

    ![NuGet Package Manager window][img-servicenuget]
1. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Shared;

1. Add the following `using` statement if not already present in the default statements.

        using System.Threading.Tasks;
        
1. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the placeholder with the IoT Hub connection string for the hub that you created in the previous section.
   
        static string connString = "{iot hub connection string}";
        static ServiceClient client;
        static JobClient jobClient;
        
1. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        public static async Task MonitorJob(string jobId)
        {
            JobResponse result;
            do
            {
                result = await jobClient.GetJobAsync(jobId);
                Console.WriteLine("Job Status : " + result.Status.ToString());
                Thread.Sleep(2000);
            } while ((result.Status != JobStatus.Completed) && (result.Status != JobStatus.Failed));
        }
                
1. Add the following method to the **Program** class:

        public static async Task StartMethodJob(string jobId)
        {
            CloudToDeviceMethod directMethod = new CloudToDeviceMethod("lockDoor", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

            JobResponse result = await jobClient.ScheduleDeviceMethodAsync(jobId,
                "deviceId='myDeviceId'",
                directMethod,
                DateTime.Now,
                10);

            Console.WriteLine("Started Method Job");
        }

1. Add the following method to the **Program** class:

        public static async Task StartTwinUpdateJob(string jobId)
        {
            var twin = new Twin();
            twin.Properties.Desired["Building"] = "43";
            twin.Properties.Desired["Floor"] = "3";
            twin.ETag = "*";

            JobResponse result = await jobClient.ScheduleTwinUpdateAsync(jobId,
                "deviceId='myDeviceId'",
                twin,
                DateTime.Now,
                10);

            Console.WriteLine("Started Twin Update Job");
        }
 

1. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
        jobClient = JobClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connString);

        string methodJobId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

        StartMethodJob(methodJobId);
        MonitorJob(methodJobId).Wait();
        Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to run the next job.");
        Console.ReadLine();

        string twinUpdateJobId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

        StartTwinUpdateJob(twinUpdateJobId);
        MonitorJob(twinUpdateJobId).Wait();
        Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to exit.");
        Console.ReadLine();

1. In the Solution Explorer, open the **Set StartUp projects...** and make sure the **Action** for **ScheduleJob** project is **Start**. Build the solution.

## <a name="create-a-simulated-device-app"></a>Create a simulated device app
In this section, you create a Node.js console app that responds to a direct method called by the cloud, which triggers a simulated device reboot and uses the reported properties to enable device twin queries to identify devices and when they last rebooted.

1. Create a new empty folder called **simDevice**.  In the **simDevice** folder, create a package.json file using the following command at your command prompt.  Accept all the defaults:
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```
1. At your command prompt in the **simDevice** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device** and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** packages:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-mqtt --save
    ```
1. Using a text editor, create a new **simDevice.js** file in the **simDevice** folder.
1. Add the following 'require' statements at the start of the **simDevice.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var Client = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
    var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Mqtt;
    ```
1. Add a **connectionString** variable and use it to create a **Client** instance. Make sure to replace the placeholders with values appropriate to your setup.
   
    ```
    var connectionString = 'HostName={youriothostname};DeviceId={yourdeviceid};SharedAccessKey={yourdevicekey}';
    var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString, Protocol);
    ```
1. Add the following function to handle the **lockDoor** method.
   
    ```
    var onLockDoor = function(request, response) {
   
        // Respond the cloud app for the direct method
        response.send(200, function(err) {
            if (!err) {
                console.error('An error occured when sending a method response:\n' + err.toString());
            } else {
                console.log('Response to method \'' + request.methodName + '\' sent successfully.');
            }
        });
   
        console.log('Locking Door!');
    };
    ```
1. Add the following code to register the handler for the **lockDoor** method.
   
    ```
    client.open(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Could not connect to IotHub client.');
        }  else {
            console.log('Client connected to IoT Hub.  Waiting for lockDoor direct method.');
            client.onDeviceMethod('lockDoor', onLockDoor);
        }
    });
    ```
1. Save and close the **simDevice.js** file.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling][lnk-transient-faults].

## <a name="run-the-apps"></a>Run the apps
You are now ready to run the apps.

1. At the command prompt in the **simDevice** folder, run the following command to begin listening for the reboot direct method.
   
    ```
    node simDevice.js
    ```
1. Run the C# console app **ScheduleJob** by right-clicking on the **ScheduleJob** project, then selecting **Debug** and **Start new instance**.

1. You see the output from both device and back-end apps.
