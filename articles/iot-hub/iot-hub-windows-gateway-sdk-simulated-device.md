# <a name="use-the-azure-iot-gateway-sdk-to-send-device-to-cloud-messages-with-a-simulated-device-windows"></a>Use the Azure IoT Gateway SDK to send device-to-cloud messages with a simulated device (Windows)
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector.md)]

## <a name="build-and-run-the-sample"></a>Build and run the sample
Before you get started, you must:

* [Set up your development environment][lnk-setupdevbox] for working with the SDK on Windows.
* [Create an IoT hub][lnk-create-hub] in your Azure subscription, you need the name of your hub to complete this walkthrough. If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.
* Add two devices to your IoT hub and make a note of their ids and device keys. You can use the [device explorer][lnk-device-explorer] or [iothub-explorer][lnk-iothub-explorer] tool to add your devices to the IoT hub you created in the previous step and retrieve their keys.

To build the sample:

1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2015** or **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017** command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
3. Run the **tools\\build.cmd** script. This script creates a Visual Studio solution file and builds the solution. You can find the Visual Studio solution in the **build** folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository. Additional parameters can be given to the script to build and run unit and end to end tests. These parameters are **--run-unittests** and **--run-e2e-tests** respectively.

To run the sample:

In a text editor, open the file **samples\\simulated_device_cloud_upload\\src\\simulated_device_cloud_upload_win.json** in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository. This file configures the modules in the sample gateway:

* The **IoTHub** module connects to your IoT hub. You configure it to send data to your IoT hub. Specifically, set the **IoTHubName** value to the name of your IoT hub and set the **IoTHubSuffix** value to **azure-devices.net**. Set the **Transport** value to one of: "HTTP", "AMQP", or "MQTT." Currently, only "HTTP" shares one TCP connection for all device messages. If you set the value to "AMQP", or "MQTT", the gateway maintains a separate TCP connection to IoT Hub for each device.
* The **mapping** module maps the MAC addresses of your simulated devices to your IoT Hub device ids. Make sure that **deviceId** values match the ids of the two devices you added to your IoT hub, and that the **deviceKey** values contain the keys of your two devices.
* The **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules are the simulated devices. Note how the module MAC addresses match the addresses in the **mapping** module.
* The **Logger** module logs your gateway activity to a file.
* The **module path** values shown in the following example assume that you cloned the IoT Gateway SDK repository to the root of your **C:** drive. If you downloaded it to another location, you need to adjust the **module path** values accordingly.
* The **links** array at the bottom of the JSON file connects the **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules to the **mapping** module, and the **mapping** module to the **IoTHub** module. It also ensures that all messages are logged by the **Logger** module.

        { "source" : "mapping", "sink" : "IotHub" }

```

Save any changes you made to the configuration file.

To run the sample:

1. At a command prompt, navigate to the root folder of your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
2. Run the following command:
   
    ```
    build\samples\simulated_device_cloud_upload\Debug\simulated_device_cloud_upload_sample.exe samples\simulated_device_cloud_upload\src\simulated_device_cloud_upload_win.json
    ```
3. You can use the [device explorer][lnk-device-explorer] or [iothub-explorer][lnk-iothub-explorer] tool to monitor the messages that IoT hub receives from the gateway.
