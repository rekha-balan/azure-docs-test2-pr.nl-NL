# <a name="connect-raspberry-pi-to-azure-iot-hub-c"></a>Connect Raspberry Pi to Azure IoT Hub (C)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-device-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-device-selector.md)]

In this tutorial, you begin by learning the basics of working with Raspberry Pi that's running Raspbian. You then learn how to seamlessly connect your devices to the cloud by using [Azure IoT Hub](iot-hub-what-is-iot-hub.md). For Windows 10 IoT Core samples, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://www.windowsondevices.com/).

## <a name="what-you-do"></a>What you do

* Setup Raspberry Pi.
* Create an IoT hub.
* Register a device for Pi in your IoT hub.
* Run a sample application on Pi to send sensor data to your IoT hub.

Connect Raspberry Pi to an IoT hub that you create. Then you run a sample application on Pi to collect temperature and humidity data from a BME280 sensor. Finally, you send the sensor data to your IoT hub.

## <a name="what-you-learn"></a>What you learn

* How to create an Azure IoT hub and get your new device connection string.
* How to connect Pi with a BME280 sensor.
* How to collect sensor data by running a sample application on Pi.
* How to send sensor data to your IoT hub.

## <a name="what-you-need"></a>What you need

![What you need](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/iot-hub/media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/0_starter_kit.jpg)

* The Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry Pi 3 board.
* An active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure account, [create a free Azure trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in just a few minutes.

## <a name="run-a-sample-application-on-pi"></a>Run a sample application on Pi

### <a name="install-the-prerequisite-packages"></a>Install the prerequisite packages

1. Use one of the following SSH clients from your host computer to connect to your Raspberry Pi.
    - [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) for Windows.
    - The built-in SSH client on Ubuntu or macOS.

1. Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C and Cmake by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   grep -q -F 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/aziotsdklinux/ppa-azureiot/ubuntu vivid main' /etc/apt/sources.list || sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/aziotsdklinux/ppa-azureiot/ubuntu vivid main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list"
   grep -q -F 'deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/aziotsdklinux/ppa-azureiot/ubuntu vivid main' /etc/apt/sources.list || sudo sh -c "echo 'deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/aziotsdklinux/ppa-azureiot/ubuntu vivid main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list"
   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys FDA6A393E4C2257F
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y azure-iot-sdk-c-dev cmake
   ```


### <a name="configure-the-sample-application"></a>Configure the sample application

1. Clone the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https//github.com/Azure-samples/iot-hub-c-raspberry-pi-clientapp
   ```
1. Open the config file by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd iot-hub-c-raspberry-pi-clientapp
   nano config.json
   ```

   ![Config file](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/iot-hub/media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/6_config-file.png)

   There are two macros in this file you can configurate. The first one is `INTERVAL`, which defines the time interval between two messages that send to cloud. The second one `SIMULATED_DATA`,which is a Boolean value for whether to use simulated sensor data or not.

   If you **don't have the sensor**, set the `SIMULATED_DATA` value to `1` to make the sample application create and use simulated sensor data.

1. Save and exit by pressing Control-O > Enter > Control-X.

### <a name="build-and-run-the-sample-application"></a>Build and run the sample application

1. Build the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cmake . && make
   ```
   ![Build output](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/iot-hub/media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/7_build-output.png)

1. Run the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo ./app '<device connection string>'
   ```

   > [!NOTE] 
   Make sure you copy-paste the device connection string into the single quotes.


You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.
