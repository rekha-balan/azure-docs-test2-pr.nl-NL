You have now created your IoT hub. The host name and connection string that you noted down will be used later.

### <a name="register-a-device-for-sparkfun-esp8266-thing-dev-in-your-iot-hub"></a>Register a device for Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev in your IoT hub

Every IoT hub has an identity registry that stores information about the devices that are permitted to connect to the IoT hub. Before a device can connect to an IoT hub, there must be an entry for that device in the IoT hub's identity registry.

In this section, you will use a CLI tool iothub explorer to register a device for ESP8266 Thing Dev in the identity registry of your IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> iothub explorer requires Node.js 4.x or higher to work properly.

To register a device for ESP8266 Thing Dev, follow these steps:

1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the latest LTS version of Node.js, NPM included.
1. Install iothub explorer by using NPM.

   * Windows 7 or later Start a command prompt as an administrator. Install iothub explorer by running the following command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g iothub-explorer
     ```
   * Ubuntu 16.04 or later Open a terminal by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T, and then run the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo npm install -g iothub-explorer
     ```
   * macOS 10.1 or later Open a terminal, and then run the following command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g iothub-explorer
     ```
1. Log in to your IoT hub by running the following command:

   ```bash
   iothub-explorer login [your iot hub connection string]
   ```
1. Register a new device, which `deviceID` is `new-device`, and get its connection string by running the following command.

   ```bash
   iothub-explorer create new-device --connection-string
   ```

Make a note of the connection string of the registered device, it will be used later.

### <a name="connect-a-dht22-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-to-esp8266-thing-dev"></a>Connect a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor to ESP8266 Thing Dev

Use the breadboard and jumper wires to make the connection as follows. If you don’t have a sensor, skip this section because you can use simulated sensor data instead.

![connections reference](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/iot-hub/media/iot-hub-sparkfun-thing-dev-get-started/15_connections_on_breadboard.png)

For sensor pins, we will use the following wiring:

| Start (Sensor)           | End (Board)           | Cable Color   |
| -----------------------  | ---------------------- | ------------: |
| VDD (Pin 27F)            | 3V (Pin 8A)           | Red cable     |
| DATA (Pin 28F)           | GPIO 2 (Pin 9A)       | White cable    |
| GND (Pin 30F)            | GND (Pin 7J)          | Black cable   |

### <a name="add-serial-port-permissions--ubuntu-only"></a>Add serial port permissions – Ubuntu only

If you use Ubuntu, make sure a normal user has the permissions to operate on the USB port of Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev. To add serial port permissions for a normal user, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands at a terminal:

   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
   ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
   ```

   You get one of the following outputs:

   * crw-rw---- 1 root uucp xxxxxxxx
   * crw-rw---- 1 root dialout xxxxxxxx

   In the output, notice `uucp` or `dialout` that is the group owner name of the USB port.

1. Add the user to the group by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G <group-owner-name> <username>
   ```

   `<group-owner-name>` is the group owner name you obtained in the previous step. `<username>` is your Ubuntu user name.

1. Log out Ubuntu and log in it again for the change to take effect.

## <a name="collect-sensor-data-and-send-it-to-your-iot-hub"></a>Collect sensor data and send it to your IoT hub
