### <a name="register-a-device-for-feather-huzzah-esp8266-in-your-iot-hub"></a>Register a device for Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 in your IoT hub

Every IoT hub has an identity registry that stores information about the devices that are permitted to connect to the IoT hub. Before a device can connect to an IoT hub, there must be an entry for that device in the identity registry for that IoT hub.


In this section, you use a CLI tool called *iothub explorer*. Use this tool to register a device for Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 in the identity registry of your IoT hub.



> [!NOTE]
> iothub explorer requires Node.js 4.x or later to work properly.

To register a device for Feather HUZZAH ESP8266, follow these steps:

1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the latest LTS version of Node.js, NPM included.
1. Install iothub explorer by using NPM.

   * Windows 7 or later:

     Start a command prompt as an administrator. Install iothub explorer by running the following command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g iothub-explorer
     ```

   * Ubuntu 16.04 or later:

     Open a terminal by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T, and then run the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo npm install -g iothub-explorer
     ```

   * MacOS 10.1 or later:

     Open a terminal, and then run the following command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g iothub-explorer
     ```

3. Log in to your IoT hub by running the following command:

   ```bash
   iothub-explorer login [your IoT hub connection string]
   ```

4. Register a new device. In the next example, `deviceID` is `new-device`. Get its connection string by running the following command.

   ```bash
   iothub-explorer create new-device --connection-string
   ```

Make a note of the connection string of the registered device. It's used later.


> [!NOTE]
> To view the connection string of registered devices, run the `iothub-explorer list` command.
