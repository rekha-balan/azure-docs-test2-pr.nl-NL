# <a name="schedule-jobs-on-multiple-devices"></a>Schedule jobs on multiple devices
## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
As described by previous articles, Azure IoT Hub enables a number of building blocks ([device twin properties and tags][lnk-twin-devguide] and [direct methods][lnk-dev-methods]).  Typically, back-end apps enable device administrators and operators to update and interact with IoT devices in bulk and at a scheduled time.  Jobs encapsulate the execution of device twin updates and direct methods against a set of devices at a schedule time.  For example, an operator would use a back-end app that would initiate and track a job to reboot a set of devices in building 43 and floor 3 at a time that would not be disruptive to the operations of the building.

### <a name="when-to-use"></a>When to use
Consider using jobs when: a solution back end needs to schedule and track progress any of the following activities on a set of device:

* Update desired properties
* Update tags
* Invoke direct methods

## <a name="job-lifecycle"></a>Job lifecycle
Jobs are initiated by the solution back end and maintained by IoT Hub.  You can initiate a job through a service-facing URI (`{iot hub}/jobs/v2/{device id}/methods/<jobID>?api-version=2016-11-14`) and query for progress on an executing job through a service-facing URI (`{iot hub}/jobs/v2/<jobId>?api-version=2016-11-14`).  Once a job is initiated, querying for jobs enables the back-end app to refresh the status of running jobs.

> [!NOTE]
> When you initiate a job, property names and values can only contain US-ASCII printable alphanumeric, except any in the following set: ``{'$', '(', ')', '<', '>', '@', ',', ';', ':', '\', '"', '/', '[', ']', '?', '=', '{', '}', SP, HT}``.

## <a name="reference-topics"></a>Reference topics:
The following reference topics provide you with more information about using jobs.

## <a name="jobs-to-execute-direct-methods"></a>Jobs to execute direct methods
The following is the HTTP 1.1 request details for executing a [direct method][lnk-dev-methods] on a set of devices using a job:

    ```
    PUT /jobs/v2/<jobId>?api-version=2016-11-14

    Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Request-Id: <guid>
    User-Agent: <sdk-name>/<sdk-version>

    {
        jobId: '<jobId>',
        type: 'scheduleDirectRequest', 
        cloudToDeviceMethod: {
            methodName: '<methodName>',
            payload: <payload>,                 
            responseTimeoutInSeconds: methodTimeoutInSeconds 
        },
        queryCondition: '<queryOrDevices>', // query condition
        startTime: <jobStartTime>,          // as an ISO-8601 date string
        maxExecutionTimeInSeconds: <maxExecutionTimeInSeconds>        
    }
    ```
The query condition can also be on a single device Id or on a list of device Ids as shown below

**Examples**
```
queryCondition = "deviceId = 'MyDevice1'"
queryCondition = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1','MyDevice2']"
queryCondition = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1']
```
[IoT Hub Query Language][lnk-query] covers IoT Hub query language in additional detail.

## <a name="jobs-to-update-device-twin-properties"></a>Jobs to update device twin properties
The following is the HTTP 1.1 request details for updating device twin properties using a job:

    ```
    PUT /jobs/v2/<jobId>?api-version=2016-11-14
    Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Request-Id: <guid>
    User-Agent: <sdk-name>/<sdk-version>

    {
        jobId: '<jobId>',
        type: 'scheduleTwinUpdate', 
        updateTwin: <patch>                 // Valid JSON object
        queryCondition: '<queryOrDevices>', // query condition
        startTime: <jobStartTime>,          // as an ISO-8601 date string
        maxExecutionTimeInSeconds: <maxExecutionTimeInSeconds>        // format TBD
    }
    ```

## <a name="querying-for-progress-on-jobs"></a>Querying for progress on jobs
The following is the HTTP 1.1 request details for [querying for jobs][lnk-query]:

    ```
    GET /jobs/v2/query?api-version=2016-11-14[&jobType=<jobType>][&jobStatus=<jobStatus>][&pageSize=<pageSize>][&continuationToken=<continuationToken>]

    Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Request-Id: <guid>
    User-Agent: <sdk-name>/<sdk-version>
    ```

The continuationToken is provided from the response.  

## <a name="jobs-properties"></a>Jobs Properties
The following is a list of properties and corresponding descriptions, which can be used when querying for jobs or job results.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **jobId** |Application provided ID for the job. |
| **startTime** |Application provided start time (ISO-8601) for the job. |
| **endTime** |IoT Hub provided date (ISO-8601) for when the job completed. Valid only after the job reaches the 'completed' state. |
| **type** |Types of jobs: |
| **scheduledUpdateTwin**: A job used to update a set of desired properties or tags. | |
| **scheduledDeviceMethod**: A job used to invoke a device method on a set of device twins. | |
| **status** |Current state of the job. Possible values for status: |
| **pending** : Scheduled and waiting to be picked up by the job service. | |
| **scheduled** : Scheduled for a time in the future. | |
| **running** : Currently active job. | |
| **cancelled** : Job has been cancelled. | |
| **failed** : Job failed. | |
| **completed** : Job has completed. | |
| **deviceJobStatistics** |Statistics about the job's execution. |

**deviceJobStatistics** properties.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **deviceJobStatistics.deviceCount** |Number of devices in the job. |
| **deviceJobStatistics.failedCount** |Number of devices where the job failed. |
| **deviceJobStatistics.succeededCount** |Number of devices where the job succeeded. |
| **deviceJobStatistics.runningCount** |Number of devices that are currently running the job. |
| **deviceJobStatistics.pendingCount** |Number of devices that are pending to run the job. |
