# <a name="send-and-receive-messages-with-iot-hub"></a>Send and receive messages with IoT Hub
## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
IoT Hub provides the following messaging primitives to communicate with a device:

* [Device-to-cloud][lnk-d2c] from a device to a back-end app.
* [Cloud-to-device][lnk-c2d] from a back-end app (*service* or *cloud*).

Core properties of IoT Hub messaging functionality are the reliability and durability of messages. These properties enable resilience to intermittent connectivity on the device side, and to load spikes in event processing on the cloud side. IoT Hub implements *at least once* delivery guarantees for both device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging.

IoT Hub supports multiple [device-facing protocols][lnk-protocols] (such as MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP). To support seamless interoperability across protocols, IoT Hub defines a [common message format][lnk-message-format] that all device-facing protocols support.

IoT Hub exposes a built-in [Event Hub-compatible endpoint][lnk-compatible-endpoint] to enable back-end apps to read the device-to-cloud messages received by the hub. You can also create custom endpoints in your IoT hub by linking other services in your subscription to the hub.

### <a name="when-to-use"></a>When to use
Use device-to-cloud messages for sending time series telemetry and alerts from your device app, and cloud-to-device messages for one-way notifications to the device app.

Refer to [Device-to-cloud communication guidance][lnk-d2c-guidance] if in doubt between using reported properties, device-to-cloud messages, or file upload.
Refer to [Cloud-to-device communication guidance][lnk-c2d-guidance] if in doubt between using desired properties, direct methods, or cloud-to-device messages.

For a comparison of the IoT Hub and Event Hubs services, see [Comparison of IoT Hub and Event Hubs][lnk-compare].

## <a name="device-to-cloud-messages"></a>Device-to-cloud messages
You send device-to-cloud messages through a device-facing endpoint (**/devices/{deviceId}/messages/events**). Routing rules then route your messages to one of the service-facing endpoints on your IoT hub. Routing rules use the properties of the device-to-cloud messages flowing through your hub to determine where to route them. By default, messages are routed to the built-in service-facing endpoint (messages/events), that is compatible with [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs]. Therefore, you can use standard [Event Hubs integration and SDKs][lnk-compatible-endpoint] to receive device-to-cloud messages.

IoT Hub implements device-to-cloud messaging using a streaming messaging pattern. IoT Hub's device-to-cloud messages are more like [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs] *events* than [Service Bus][lnk-servicebus] *messages* in that there is a high volume of events passing through the service that can be read by multiple readers.

This implementation has the following implications:

* Like Event Hubs events, device-to-cloud messages are durable and retained in an IoT hub's default **messages/events** endpoint for up to seven days.
* Like Event Hubs events, device-to-cloud messages can be at most 256 KB, and can be grouped in batches to optimize sends. Batches can be at most 256 KB.

There are, however, a few important distinctions between IoT Hub device-to-cloud messaging and Event Hubs:

* As explained in the [Control access to IoT Hub][lnk-devguide-security] section, IoT Hub allows per-device authentication and access control.
* IoT Hub allows you to create up to 10 custom endpoints. Messages are delivered to the endpoints based on routes configured on your IoT hub.
* IoT Hub allows millions of simultaneously connected devices (see [Quotas and throttling][lnk-quotas]), while Event Hubs is limited to 5000 AMQP connections per namespace.
* IoT Hub does not allow arbitrary partitioning using a **PartitionKey**. Device-to-cloud messages are partitioned based on their originating **deviceId**.
* Scaling IoT Hub is slightly different than scaling Event Hubs. For more information, see [Scaling IoT Hub][lnk-guidance-scale].

For details about how to use device-to-cloud messaging, see [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-sdks].

For details about how to set up message routing, see [Routing rules](#routing-rules).

> [!NOTE]
> When using HTTP to send device-to-cloud messages, property names and values can only contain ASCII alphanumeric characters, plus ``{'!', '#', '$', '%, '&', "'", '*', '*', '+', '-', '.', '^', '_', '`', '|', '~'}``.
> 
> 

### <a name="non-telemetry-traffic"></a>Non-telemetry traffic
Often, in addition to telemetry data points, devices send messages and requests that require separate execution and handling from the application business logic layer. For example, critical alerts that must trigger a specific action in the back end. You can easily write a routing rule to send these types of messages to an endpoint dedicated to their processing.

For more information about the best way to process this kind of message, see the [Tutorial: How to process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages][lnk-d2c-tutorial] tutorial.

### <a name="routing-rules"></a>Routing rules

IoT Hub enables you to route messages to IoT Hub endpoints based on message properties. Routing rules give you the flexibility to send messages where they need to go without the need to stand up additional services to process messages or to write additional code. Each routing rule you configure has the following properties:

* **Name**. The unique name that identifies the rule.
* **Source**. The origin of the data stream to be acted upon. For example, device telemetry.
* **Condition**. The query expression for the routing rule that is run against the message's properties and used to determine whether it is a match for the endpoint. For more information about constructing a route condition, see the [Reference - query language for device twins and jobs][lnk-devguide-query-language].
* **Endpoint**. The name of the endpoint where IoT Hub sends messages that match the condition. Endpoints should be in the same region as the IoT hub, otherwise you may be charged for cross-region writes.

A single message may match the condition on multiple routing rules, in which case IoT Hub delivers the message to the endpoint associated with each matched rule. IoT Hub also automatically deduplicates message delivery, so if a message matches multiple rules that all have the same destination, it is only written to that destination once.

For more information about creating custom endpoints in IoT Hub, see [IoT Hub endpoints][lnk-devguide-endpoints].

### <a name="built-in-endpoint-messagesevents"></a>Built-in endpoint: messages/events

An IoT hub exposes the following properties to enable you to control the built-in Event Hub-compatible messaging endpoint **messages/events**.

* **Partition count**. Set this property at creation to define the number of [partitions][lnk-event-hub-partitions] for device-to-cloud event ingestion.
* **Retention time**. This property specifies how long in days messages are retained by IoT Hub. The default is one day, but it can be increased to seven days.

IoT Hub also enables you to manage consumer groups on the built-in device-to-cloud receive endpoint.

By default, all messages that do not explicitly match a message routing rule are written to the built-in endpoint. If you disable this fallback route, messages that do not explicitly match any message routing rules are dropped.

You can modify the retention time, either programmatically through the [IoT Hub resource provider REST APIs][lnk-resource-provider-apis], or by using the [Azure portal][lnk-management-portal].

### <a name="anti-spoofing-properties"></a>Anti-spoofing properties
To avoid device spoofing in device-to-cloud messages, IoT Hub stamps all messages with the following properties:

* **ConnectionDeviceId**
* **ConnectionDeviceGenerationId**
* **ConnectionAuthMethod**

The first two contain the **deviceId** and **generationId** of the originating device, as per [Device identity properties][lnk-device-properties].

The **ConnectionAuthMethod** property contains a JSON serialized object, with the following properties:

```
{
  "scope": "{ hub | device}",
  "type": "{ symkey | sas}",
  "issuer": "iothub"
}
```

## <a name="cloud-to-device-messages"></a>Cloud-to-device messages
You send cloud-to-device messages through a service-facing endpoint (**/messages/devicebound**). A device receives them through a device-specific endpoint (**/devices/{deviceId}/messages/devicebound**).

Each cloud-to-device message is targeted at a single device by setting the **to** property to **/devices/{deviceId}/messages/devicebound**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each device queue holds at most 50 cloud-to-device messages. Trying to send more messages to the same device results in an error.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> When you send cloud-to-device messages, property names and values can only contain ASCII alphanumeric characters, plus ``{'!', '#', '$', '%, '&', "'", '*', '*', '+', '-', '.', '^', '_', '`', '|', '~'}``.
> 
> 

### <a name="message-lifecycle"></a>Message lifecycle
To guarantee at least once message delivery, IoT Hub persists cloud-to-device messages in per-device queues. Devices must explicitly acknowledge *completion* for IoT Hub to remove them from the queue. This guarantees resiliency against connectivity and device failures.

The following diagram shows the lifecycle state graph for a cloud-to-device message.

![Cloud-to-device message lifecycle][img-lifecycle]

When the service sends a message, it is considered *Enqueued*. When a device wants to *receive* a message, IoT Hub *locks* the message (sets the state to **Invisible**) allowing other threads on the same device to start receiving other messages. When a device thread completes the processing of a message, it notifies IoT Hub by *completing* the message.

A device can also:

* *Reject* the message, which causes IoT Hub to set it to the **Deadlettered** state. Note: devices connecting with MQTT cannot reject cloud-to-device messages.
* *Abandon* the message, which causes IoT Hub to put the message back in the queue, with the state set to **Enqueued**.

A thread could fail to process a message without notifying IoT Hub. In this case, messages automatically transition from the **Invisible** state back to the **Enqueued** state after a *visibility (or lock) timeout*. The default value of this timeout is one minute.

A message can transition between the **Enqueued** and **Invisible** states for, at most, the number of times specified in the **max delivery count** property on IoT Hub. After that number of transitions, IoT Hub sets the state of the message to **Deadlettered**. Similarly, IoT Hub sets the state of a message to **Deadlettered** after its expiration time (see [Time to live][lnk-ttl]).

For a tutorial on cloud-to-device messages, see [Tutorial: How to send cloud-to-device messages with IoT Hub][lnk-c2d-tutorial]. For reference topics on how the different Azure IoT SDKs expose the cloud-to-device functionality, see [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-sdks].

> [!NOTE]
> Typically, cloud-to-device messages complete whenever the loss of the message would not affect the application logic. For example, the message content has been successfully persisted in local storage, or an operation has been successfully executed. The message could also be carrying transient information, whose loss would not impact the functionality of the application. Sometimes, for long-running tasks, you can complete the cloud-to-device message after persisting the task description in local storage. Then you can notify the solution back end with one or more device-to-cloud messages at various stages of progress of the task.
> 
> 

### <a name="message-expiration-time-to-live"></a>Message expiration (time to live)
Every cloud-to-device message has an expiration time. This time is set either by the service (in the **ExpiryTimeUtc** property), or by IoT Hub using the default *time to live* specified as an IoT Hub property. See [Cloud-to-device configuration options][lnk-c2d-configuration].

> [!NOTE]
> A common way to take advantage of message expiration and avoid sending messages to disconnected devices, is to set short time to live values. This approach achieves the same result as maintaining the device connection state, while being more efficient. When you request message acknowledgements, IoT Hub notifies you which devices are able to receive messages, and which devices are not online or have failed.
> 
> 

### <a name="message-feedback"></a>Message feedback
When you send a cloud-to-device message, the service can request the delivery of per-message feedback regarding the final state of that message.

* If you set the **Ack** property to **positive**, IoT Hub generates a feedback message if, and only if, the cloud-to-device message reached the **Completed** state.
* If you set the **Ack** property to **negative**, IoT Hub generates a feedback message, if and only if, the cloud-to-device message reaches the **Deadlettered** state.
* If you set the **Ack** property to **full**, IoT Hub generates a feedback message in either case.

> [!NOTE]
> If **Ack** is **full**, and you don't receive a feedback message, it means that the feedback message expired. The service can't know what happened to the original message. In practice, a service should ensure that it can process the feedback before it expires. The maximum expiry time is two days, which allows plenty of time to get the service running again if a failure occurs.
> 
> 

As explained in [Endpoints][lnk-endpoints], IoT Hub delivers feedback through a service-facing endpoint (**/messages/servicebound/feedback**) as messages. The semantics for receiving feedback are the same as for cloud-to-device messages, and have the same [Message lifecycle][lnk-lifecycle]. Whenever possible, message feedback is batched in a single message, with the following format:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| EnqueuedTime |Timestamp indicating when the message was created. |
| UserId |`{iot hub name}` |
| ContentType |`application/vnd.microsoft.iothub.feedback.json` |

The body is a JSON-serialized array of records, each with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| EnqueuedTimeUtc |Timestamp indicating when the outcome of the message happened. For example, the device completed or the message expired. |
| OriginalMessageId |**MessageId** of the cloud-to-device message to which this feedback information pertains. |
| StatusCode |Required string. Used in feedback messages generated by IoT Hub. <br/> 'Success' <br/> 'Expired' <br/> 'DeliveryCountExceeded' <br/> 'Rejected' <br/> 'Purged' |
| Description |String values for **StatusCode**. |
| DeviceId |**DeviceId** of the target device of the cloud-to-device message to which this piece of feedback pertains. |
| DeviceGenerationId |**DeviceGenerationId** of the target device of the cloud-to-device message to which this piece of feedback pertains. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The service must specify a **MessageId** for the cloud-to-device message to be able to correlate its feedback with the original message.
> 
> 

The following example shows the body of a feedback message.

```
[
  {
    "OriginalMessageId": "0987654321",
    "EnqueuedTimeUtc": "2015-07-28T16:24:48.789Z",
    "StatusCode": 0
    "Description": "Success",
    "DeviceId": "123",
    "DeviceGenerationId": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  },
  {
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

### <a name="cloud-to-device-configuration-options"></a>Cloud-to-device configuration options
Each IoT hub exposes the following configuration options for cloud-to-device messaging.

| Property | Description | Range and default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| defaultTtlAsIso8601 |Default TTL for cloud-to-device messages. |ISO_8601 interval up to 2D (minimum 1 minute). Default: 1 hour. |
| maxDeliveryCount |Maximum delivery count for cloud-to-device per-device queues. |1 to 100. Default: 10. |
| feedback.ttlAsIso8601 |Retention for service-bound feedback messages. |ISO_8601 interval up to 2D (minimum 1 minute). Default: 1 hour. |
| feedback.maxDeliveryCount |Maximum delivery count for feedback queue. |1 to 100. Default: 100. |

For more information, see [Create IoT hubs][lnk-portal].

## <a name="read-device-to-cloud-messages"></a>Read device-to-cloud messages
IoT Hub exposes the **messages/events** built-in endpoint for your back-end services to read the device-to-cloud messages received by your hub. This endpoint is Event Hub-compatible, which enables you to use any of the mechanisms the Event Hubs service supports for reading messages.

You can also create custom endpoints in IoT Hub. IoT Hub currently supports Event Hubs, Service Bus queues, and Service Bus topics as custom endpoints. For more information about reading from those services, see: reading from [Event Hubs][lnk-getstarted-eh], reading from [Service Bus queues][lnk-getstarted-queue], reading from [Service Bus topics][lnk-getstarted-topic].

### <a name="reading-from-the-built-in-endpoint"></a>Reading from the built-in endpoint

When you use the [Azure Service Bus SDK for .NET][lnk-servicebus-sdk] or the [Event Hubs - Event Processor Host][lnk-eventprocessorhost], you can use any IoT Hub connection strings with the correct permissions. Then use **messages/events** as the Event Hub name.

When you use SDKs (or product integrations) that are unaware of IoT Hub, you must retrieve an Event Hub-compatible endpoint and Event Hub-compatible name from the IoT Hub settings in the [Azure portal][lnk-management-portal]:

1. In the IoT hub blade, click **Endpoints**.
2. In the **Built-in endpoints** section, click **Events**. The blade contains the following values: **Event Hub-compatible endpoint**, **Event Hub-compatible name**, **Partitions**, **Retention time**, and **Consumer groups**.
   
    ![Device-to-cloud settings][img-eventhubcompatible]

> [!NOTE]
> The IoT Hub SDK requires the IoT Hub endpoint name, which is **messages/events** as shown in the **Endpoints** blade.
>
>

> [!NOTE]
> If the SDK you are using requires a **Hostname** or **Namespace** value, remove the scheme from the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint**. For example, if your Event Hub-compatible endpoint is **sb://iothub-ns-myiothub-1234.servicebus.windows.net/**, the **Hostname** would be **iothub-ns-myiothub-1234.servicebus.windows.net**, and the **Namespace** would be **iothub-ns-myiothub-1234**.
> 
>

You can then use any shared access policy that has the **ServiceConnect** permissions to connect to the specified Event Hub.

If you need to build an Event Hub connection string by using the previous information, use the following pattern:

```
Endpoint={Event Hub-compatible endpoint};SharedAccessKeyName={iot hub policy name};SharedAccessKey={iot hub policy key}
```

The following is a list of SDKs and integrations that you can use with Event Hub-compatible endpoints that IoT Hub exposes:

* [Java Event Hubs client](https://github.com/hdinsight/eventhubs-client)
* [Apache Storm spout](../hdinsight/hdinsight-storm-develop-csharp-event-hub-topology.md). You can view the [spout source](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/external/storm-eventhubs) on GitHub.
* [Apache Spark integration](../hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-eventhub-streaming.md)

## <a name="reference-topics"></a>Reference topics:
The following reference topics provide you with more information about exchanging messages with IoT Hub.

## <a name="message-format"></a>Message format
IoT Hub messages comprise:

* A set of *system properties*. Properties that IoT Hub interprets or sets. This set is predetermined.
* A set of *application properties*. A dictionary of string properties that the application can define and access, without needing to deserialize the message body. IoT Hub never modifies these properties.
* An opaque binary body.

For more information about how the message is encoded in different protocols, see [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-sdks].

The following table lists the set of system properties in IoT Hub messages.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| MessageId |A user-settable identifier for the message, used for request-reply patterns. Format: A case-sensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of ASCII 7-bit alphanumeric characters + `{'-', ':',’.', '+', '%', '_', '#', '*', '?', '!', '(', ')', ',', '=', '@', ';', '$', '''}`. |
| Sequence number |A number (unique per device-queue) assigned by IoT Hub to each cloud-to-device message. |
| To |A destination specified in [Cloud-to-Device][lnk-c2d] messages. |
| ExpiryTimeUtc |Date and time of message expiration. |
| EnqueuedTime |Date and time the [Cloud-to-Device][lnk-c2d] message was received by IoT Hub. |
| CorrelationId |A string property in a response message that typically contains the MessageId of the request, in request-reply patterns. |
| UserId |An ID used to specify the origin of messages. When messages are generated by IoT Hub, it is set to `{iot hub name}`. |
| Ack |A feedback message generator. This property is used in cloud-to-device messages to request IoT Hub to generate feedback messages as a result of the consumption of the message by the device. Possible values: **none** (default): no feedback message is generated, **positive**: receive a feedback message if the message was completed, **negative**: receive a feedback message if the message expired (or maximum delivery count was reached) without being completed by the device, or **full**: both positive and negative. For more information, see [Message feedback][lnk-feedback]. |
| ConnectionDeviceId |An ID set by IoT Hub on device-to-cloud messages. It contains the **deviceId** of the device that sent the message. |
| ConnectionDeviceGenerationId |An ID set by IoT Hub on device-to-cloud messages. It contains the **generationId** (as per [Device identity properties][lnk-device-properties]) of the device that sent the message. |
| ConnectionAuthMethod |An authentication method set by IoT Hub on device-to-cloud messages. This property contains information about the authentication method used to authenticate the device sending the message. For more information, see [Device to cloud anti-spoofing][lnk-antispoofing]. |

## <a name="message-size"></a>Message size

IoT Hub measures message size in a protocol-agnostic way, considering only the actual payload. The size in bytes is calculated as the sum of the following:

* The body size in bytes, plus
* The size in bytes of all the values of the message system properties, plus
* The size in bytes of all user property names and values.

Note that property names and values are limited to ASCII characters, so the length of the strings equals the size in bytes.

## <a name="communication-protocols"></a>Communication protocols
IoT Hub allows devices to use [MQTT][lnk-mqtt], MQTT over WebSockets, [AMQP][lnk-amqp], AMQP over WebSockets, and HTTP protocols for device-side communications. The following table provides the high-level recommendations for your choice of protocol:

| Protocol | When you should choose this protocol |
| --- | --- |
| MQTT <br> MQTT over WebSocket |Use on all devices that do not require to connect multiple devices (each with its own per-device credentials) over the same TLS connection. |
| AMQP <br> AMQP over WebSocket |Use on field and cloud gateways to take advantage of connection multiplexing across devices. |
| HTTP |Use for devices that cannot support other protocols. |

Consider the following points when you choose your protocol for device-side communications:

* **Cloud-to-device pattern**. HTTP does not have an efficient way to implement server push. As such, when you are using HTTP, devices poll IoT Hub for cloud-to-device messages. This approach is inefficient for both the device and IoT Hub. Under current HTTP guidelines, each device should poll for messages every 25 minutes or more. On the other hand, MQTT and AMQP support server push when receiving cloud-to-device messages. They enable immediate pushes of messages from IoT Hub to the device. If delivery latency is a concern, MQTT or AMQP are the best protocols to use. For rarely connected devices, HTTP works as well.
* **Field gateways**. When using MQTT and HTTP, you cannot connect multiple devices (each with its own per-device credentials) using the same TLS connection. Thus, for [Field gateway scenarios][lnk-azure-gateway-guidance], these protocols are suboptimal because they require one TLS connection between the field gateway and IoT Hub for each device connected to the field gateway.
* **Low resource devices**. The MQTT and HTTP libraries have a smaller footprint than the AMQP libraries. As such, if the device has limited resources (for example, less than 1 MB RAM), these protocols might be the only protocol implementation available.
* **Network traversal**. The standard AMQP protocol uses port 5671, while MQTT listens on port 8883, which could cause problems in networks that are closed to non-HTTP protocols. MQTT over WebSockets, AMQP over WebSockets, and HTTP are available to be used in this scenario.
* **Payload size**. MQTT and AMQP are binary protocols, which result in more compact payloads than HTTP.

> [!NOTE]
> When using HTTP, each device should poll for cloud-to-device messages every 25 minutes or more. However, during development, it is acceptable to poll more frequently than every 25 minutes.
> 
> 

## <a name="port-numbers"></a>Port numbers
Devices can communicate with IoT Hub in Azure using various protocols. Typically, the choice of protocol is driven by the specific requirements of the solution. The following table lists the outbound ports that must be open for a device to be able to use a specific protocol:

| Protocol | Port |
| --- | --- |
| MQTT |8883 |
| MQTT over WebSockets |443 |
| AMQP |5671 |
| AMQP over WebSockets |443 |
| HTTP |443 |
| LWM2M (Device management) |5684 |

Once you have created an IoT hub in an Azure region, the IoT hub keeps the same IP address for the lifetime of that IoT hub. However, to maintain quality of service, if Microsoft moves the IoT hub to a different scale unit then it is assigned a new IP address.

## <a name="notes-on-mqtt-support"></a>Notes on MQTT support
IoT Hub implements the MQTT v3.1.1 protocol with the following limitations and specific behavior:

* **QoS 2 is not supported**. When a device app publishes a message with **QoS 2**, IoT Hub closes the network connection. When a device app subscribes to a topic with **QoS 2**, IoT Hub grants maximum QoS level 1 in the **SUBACK** packet.
* **Retain messages do not persist**. If a device app publishes a message with the RETAIN flag set to 1, IoT Hub adds the **x-opt-retain** application property to the message. In this case, IoT Hub does not persist the retain message, but instead passes it to the back-end app.

For more information, see [IoT Hub MQTT support][lnk-devguide-mqtt].

As a final consideration, you should review the [Azure IoT protocol gateway][lnk-azure-protocol-gateway] that enables you to deploy a high-performance custom protocol gateway that interfaces directly with IoT Hub. The Azure IoT protocol gateway enables you to customize the device protocol to accommodate brownfield MQTT deployments or other custom protocols. This approach does require, however, that you run and operate a custom protocol gateway.

## <a name="additional-reference-material"></a>Additional reference material
Other reference topics in the IoT Hub developer guide include:

* [IoT Hub endpoints][lnk-endpoints] describes the various endpoints that each IoT hub exposes for run-time and management operations.
* [Throttling and quotas][lnk-quotas] describes the quotas that apply to the IoT Hub service and the throttling behavior to expect when you use the service.
* [Azure IoT device and service SDKs][lnk-sdks] lists the various language SDKs you can use when you develop both device and service apps that interact with IoT Hub.
* [IoT Hub query language for device twins and jobs][lnk-query] describes the IoT Hub query language you can use to retrieve information from IoT Hub about your device twins and jobs.
* [IoT Hub MQTT support][lnk-devguide-mqtt] provides more information about IoT Hub support for the MQTT protocol.
