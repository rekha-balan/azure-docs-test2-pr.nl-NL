> [!NOTE]
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md).  This article covers using the Resource Manager deployment model, which Microsoft recommends for most new deployments instead of the [classic deployment model](virtual-network-deploy-multinic-classic-cli.md).
>

## <a name="create"></a>Create the VM

You can complete this task using the Azure CLI 2.0 (this article) or the [Azure CLI 1.0](virtual-network-deploy-multinic-cli-nodejs.md). The values in "" for the variables in the steps that follow create resources with settings from the scenario. Change the values, as appropriate, for your environment.

1. Install the [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) if you don't already have it installed.
2. Create an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs by completing the steps in the [Create an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs](../virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
3. From a command shell, login with the command `az login`.
4. Create the VM by executing the script that follows on a Linux or Mac computer. The script creates a resource group, one virtual network (VNet) with two subnets, two NICs, and a VM with the two NICs attached to it. One of the NICs is connected to one subnet and is assigned a static public and private IP address. The other NIC is connected to the other subnet and is assigned a static private IP address and no public IP address. The NIC, public IP address, virtual network, and VM resources must all exist in the same location and subscription. Though the resources don't all have to exist in the same resource group, in the following script they do.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

RgName="Multi-NIC-VM"
Location="westus"

# Create a resource group.
az group create \
--name $RgName \
--location $Location

# The address is assigned to the resource from a pool of IP adresses unique to each Azure region. 
# Download and view the file from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41653 that lists
# the ranges for each region.

PipName="PIP-WEB"
az network public-ip create \
--name $PipName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--allocation-method Static

# Create a virtual network with one subnet

VnetName="VNet1"
VnetPrefix="10.0.0.0/16"
VnetSubnet1Name="Front-End"
VnetSubnet1Prefix="10.0.0.0/24"
az network vnet create \
--name $VnetName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--address-prefix $VnetPrefix \
--subnet-name $VnetSubnet1Name \
--subnet-prefix $VnetSubnet1Prefix

# Create a second subnet within the VNet

VnetSubnet2Name="Back-end"
VnetSubnet2Prefix="10.0.1.0/24"
az network vnet subnet create \
--vnet-name $VnetName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--name $VnetSubnet2Name \
--address-prefix $VnetSubnet2Prefix

# Create a network interface connected to one of the subnets. The NIC is assigned a single dynamic private and
# public IP address by default, but you can instead, assign static addresses, or no public IP address at all.
# You can also assign multiple private or public IP addresses to each NIC. To learn more about IP addressing
# options for NICs, enter the az network nic create -h command.

Nic1Name="NIC-FE"
PrivateIpAddress1="10.0.0.5"

az network nic create \
--name $Nic1Name \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--subnet $VnetSubnet1Name \
--vnet-name $VnetName \
--private-ip-address $PrivateIpAddress1 \
--public-ip-address $PipName

# Create a second network interface and connect it to the other subnet. Though multiple NICs attached to the same
# VM can be connected to different subnets, the subnets must all be within the same VNet. Add additional NICs as necessary.

Nic2Name="NIC-BE"
PrivateIpAddress2="10.0.1.5"

az network nic create \
--name $Nic2Name \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--subnet $VnetSubnet2Name \
--vnet-name $VnetName \
--private-ip-address $PrivateIpAddress2

# Create a VM and attach the two NICs.

VmName="WEB"

# Replace the value for the following **VmSize** variable with a value from the
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-sizes article. Not all VM sizes support
# more than one NIC, so be sure to select a VM size that supports the number of NICs you want to attach to the VM.
# You must create the VM with at least two NICs if you want to add more after VM creation. If you create a VM with
# only one NIC, you can't add additional NICs to the VM after VM creation, regardless of how many NICs the VM supports.
# The VM size specified in the following variable supports two NICs.

VmSize="Standard_DS2"

# Replace the value for the OsImage variable value with a value for *urn* from the output returned by entering the
# az vm image list command.

OsImage="credativ:Debian:8:latest"

Username="adminuser"

# Replace the following value with the path to your public key file.

SshKeyValue="~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

# Before executing the following command, add variable names of additional NICs you may have added to the script that
# you want to attach to the VM. If creating a Windows VM, remove the **ssh-key-value** line and you'll be prompted for
# the password you want to configure for the VM.

az vm create \
--name $VmName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--image $OsImage \
--location $Location \
--size $VmSize \
--nics $Nic1Name $Nic2Name \
--admin-username $Username \
--ssh-key-value $SshKeyValue
```

In addition to creating a VM with two NICs, the script creates:
- A single premium managed disk by default, but you have other options for the disk type you can create. Read the [Create a Linux VM using the Azure CLI 2.0](../virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article for details.
- A virtual network with two subnets and a single public IP address. Alternatively, you can use *existing* virtual network, subnet, NIC, or public IP address resources. To learn how to use existing network resources rather than creating additional resources, enter `az vm create -h`.

## <a name = "validate"></a>Validate VM creation and NICs

1. Enter the command `az resource list --resouce-group Multi-NIC-VM --output table` to see a list of the resources created by the script. There should be six resources in the returned output: Two NICs, one disk, one public IP address, one virtual network, and a virtual machine.
2. Enter the command `az network public-ip show --name PIP-WEB --resource-group Multi-NIC-VM --output table`. In the returned output, note the value of **IpAddress** and that the value of **PublicIpAllocationMethod** is *Static*.
3. Before running the following command, remove the <>, replace *Username* with the name you used for the **Username** variable in the script, and replace *ipAddress* with the **ipAddress** from the previous step. Run the following command to connect to the VM: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/azure_id_rsa <Username>@<ipAddress>`. 
4. Once connected to the VM, run the `sudo ifconfig` command to see *eth0* and *eth1* interfaces. Each NIC has been assigned the static private IP addresses specified in the script by the Azure DHCP servers. The IP and MAC addresses assigned to the NICs do not change until the VM is deleted. We recommend that you do not change IP addressing within an operating system, as it can disable connectivity to the computer. Public IP addresses do not appear within the operating system, as they are network address translated to and from the private IP address by the Azure infrastructure.

## <a name= "clean-up"></a>Remove the VM and associated resources

It's recommended that you delete the resources created in this exercise if you won't use them in production. VM, public IP address, and disk resources incur charges, as long as they're provisioned. To remove the resources created during this exercise, complete the following steps:
1. To view the resources in the resource group, run the `az resource list --resource-group Multi-NIC-VM` command.
2. Confirm there are no resources in the resource group, other than the resources created by the script in this article. 
3. To delete all resources created in this exercise, run the `az group delete --name Multi-NIC-VM` command. The command deletes the resource group and all the resources it contains.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

Any network traffic can flow to and from the VM created in this article. You can define inbound and outbound rules within an NSG that limit the traffic that can flow to and from each network interface, each subnet, or both. To learn more about NSGs, read the [NSG overview](virtual-networks-nsg.md) article.
