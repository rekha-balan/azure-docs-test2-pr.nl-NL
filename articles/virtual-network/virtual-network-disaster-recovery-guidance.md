# <a name="virtual-network--business-continuity"></a>Virtual Network â€“ Business Continuity
## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
A Virtual Network (VNet) is a logical representation of your network in the cloud. It allows you to define your own private IP address space and segment the network into subnets. VNets serves as a trust boundary to host your compute resources such as Azure Virtual Machines and Cloud Services (web/worker roles). A VNet allows direct private IP communication between the resources hosted in it. A Virtual Network can also be linked to an on-premises network through one of the hybrid options such as a VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute.

A VNet is created within the scope of a region. You can create VNets with same address space in two different regions (i.e. US East and US West but cannot connect them to one another directly).

There could be several different ways that your application could be disrupted. A given region could be completely cut off due to a natural disaster or a partial disaster due to a failure of multiple devices/services. The impact on the VNet service is different in each of these situations.

**Q: What do you do in the event of an outage to an entire region? i.e. if a region is completely cutoff due to a natural disaster? What happens to the Virtual Networks hosted in the region?**

A: The Virtual Network and the resources in the affected region remains inaccessible during the time of the service disruption.

**Q: What can I to do re-create the same Virtual Network in a different region?**

A: Virtual Network (VNet) is fairly lightweight resource. You can invoke Azure APIs to create a VNet with the same address space in a different region. To re-create the same environment that was present in the affected region, you have to make API calls to re-deploy your Cloud Services (web/worker roles) and Virtual Machines that you had. You will also have to spin up a VPN Gateway and connect to your on-premises network if you had on-premises connectivity (such as in a hybrid deployment).

The instructions for creating a VNet are found [here](virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal.md). 

**Q: Can a replica of a VNet in a given region be re-created in another region ahead of time?**

A: Yes, you can create two VNets using the same private IP address space and resources in two different regions ahead of time. If a customer was hosting internet facing services in the VNet, they could have set up Traffic Manager to geo-route traffic to the region that is active. However, a customer cannot connect two VNets with the same address space to their on-premises network as it would cause routing issues. At the time of a disaster and loss of a VNet in one region, a customer can connect the other VNet in the available region with matching address space to their on-premises network.

The instructions for creating a VNet are found [here](virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal.md).
