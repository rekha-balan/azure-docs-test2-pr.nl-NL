   > [!NOTE]
   > A VM may have multiple NICs attached to it. Each may be connected to a different subnet. Since the commands in the previous steps are run against a NIC, it's important to ensure that you specify the NIC you're having the connectivity failure to. If you're not sure, you can always run the commands against each NIC attached to the VM.
