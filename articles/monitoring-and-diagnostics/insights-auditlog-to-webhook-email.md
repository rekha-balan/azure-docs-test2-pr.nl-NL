# <a name="call-a-webhook-on-azure-activity-log-alerts"></a>Call a webhook on Azure Activity Log alerts
Webhooks allow you to route an Azure alert notification to other systems for post-processing or custom actions. You can use a webhook on an alert to route it to services that send SMS, log bugs, notify a team via chat/messaging services, or do any number of other actions. This article describes how to set a webhook to be called when an Azure Activity Log alert fires. It also shows what the payload for the HTTP POST to a webhook looks like. For information on the setup and schema for an Azure metric alert, [see this page instead](insights-webhooks-alerts.md). You can also set up an Activity Log alert to send email when activated.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in preview and will be removed at some point in the future.

You can set up an Activity Log alert using the [Azure PowerShell Cmdlets](insights-powershell-samples.md#create-alert-rules), [Cross-Platform CLI](insights-cli-samples.md#work-with-alerts), or [Azure Monitor REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn933805.aspx). Currently, you cannot set one up using the Azure portal.

## <a name="authenticating-the-webhook"></a>Authenticating the webhook
The webhook can authenticate using either of these methods:

1. **Token-based authorization** - The webhook URI is saved with a token ID, for example, `https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=sometokenid&someparameter=somevalue`
2. **Basic authorization** - The webhook URI is saved with a username and password, for example, `https://userid:password@mysamplealert/webcallback?someparamater=somevalue&foo=bar`

## <a name="payload-schema"></a>Payload schema
The POST operation contains the following JSON payload and schema for all Activity Log-based alerts. This schema is similar to the one used by metric-based alerts.

```
