# <a name="configure-a-webhook-on-an-azure-metric-alert"></a>Configure a webhook on an Azure metric alert
Webhooks allow you to route an Azure alert notification to other systems for post-processing or custom actions. You can use a webhook on an alert to route it to services that send SMS, log bugs, notify a team via chat/messaging services, or do any number of other actions. This article describes how to set a webhook on an Azure metric alert and what the payload for the HTTP POST to a webhook looks like. For information on the setup and schema for an Azure Activity Log alert (alert on events), [see this page instead](insights-auditlog-to-webhook-email.md).

Azure alerts HTTP POST the alert contents in JSON format, schema defined below, to a webhook URI that you provide when creating the alert. This URI must be a valid HTTP or HTTPS endpoint. Azure posts one entry per request when an alert is activated.

## <a name="configuring-webhooks-via-the-portal"></a>Configuring webhooks via the portal
You can add or update the webhook URI in the Create/Update Alerts screen in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

![Add an alert Rule](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/monitoring-and-diagnostics/media/insights-webhooks-alerts/Alertwebhook.png)

You can also configure an alert to post to a webhook URI using the [Azure PowerShell Cmdlets](insights-powershell-samples.md#create-alert-rules), [Cross-Platform CLI](insights-cli-samples.md#work-with-alerts), or [Azure Monitor REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn933805.aspx).

## <a name="authenticating-the-webhook"></a>Authenticating the webhook
The webhook can authenticate using token-based authorization. The webhook URI is saved with a token ID, eg. `https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=sometokenid&someparameter=somevalue`

## <a name="payload-schema"></a>Payload schema
The POST operation contains the following JSON payload and schema for all metric-based alerts.

```JSON

| Field | Mandatory | Fixed Set of Values | Notes |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| status |Y |“Activated”, “Resolved” |Status for the alert based off of the conditions you have set. |
| context |Y | |The alert context. |
| timestamp |Y | |The time at which the alert was triggered. |
| id |Y | |Every alert rule has a unique id. |
| name |Y | |The alert name. |
| description |Y | |Description of the alert. |
| conditionType |Y |“Metric”, “Event” |Two types of alerts are supported. One based on a metric condition and the other based on an event in the Activity Log. Use this value to check if the alert is based on metric or event. |
| condition |Y | |The specific fields to check for based on the conditionType. |
| metricName |for Metric alerts | |The name of the metric that defines what the rule monitors. |
| metricUnit |for Metric alerts |"Bytes", "BytesPerSecond", "Count", "CountPerSecond", "Percent", "Seconds" |The unit allowed in the metric. [Allowed values are listed here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.insights.models.unit.aspx). |
| metricValue |for Metric alerts | |The actual value of the metric that caused the alert. |
| threshold |for Metric alerts | |The threshold value at which the alert is activated. |
| windowSize |for Metric alerts | |The period of time that is used to monitor alert activity based on the threshold. Must be between 5 minutes and 1 day. ISO 8601 duration format. |
| timeAggregation |for Metric alerts |"Average", "Last", "Maximum", "Minimum", "None", "Total" |How the data that is collected should be combined over time. The default value is Average. [Allowed values are listed here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.insights.models.aggregationtype.aspx). |
| operator |for Metric alerts | |The operator used to compare the current metric data to the set threshold. |
| subscriptionId |Y | |Azure subscription ID. |
| resourceGroupName |Y | |Name of the resource group for the impacted resource. |
| resourceName |Y | |Resource name of the impacted resource. |
| resourceType |Y | |Resource type of the impacted resource. |
| resourceId |Y | |Resource ID of the impacted resource. |
| resourceRegion |Y | |Region or location of the impacted resource. |
| portalLink |Y | |Direct link to the portal resource summary page. |
| properties |N |Optional |Set of `<Key, Value>` pairs (i.e. `Dictionary<String, String>`) that includes details about the event. The properties field is optional. In a custom UI or Logic app-based workflow, users can enter key/values that can be passed via the payload. The alternate way to pass custom properties back to the webhook is via the webhook uri itself (as query parameters) |

> [!NOTE]
> The properties field can only be set using the [Azure Monitor REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn933805.aspx).
