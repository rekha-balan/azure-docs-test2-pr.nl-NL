# <a name="create-activity-log-alerts"></a>Create Activity Log Alerts

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
Activity Log Alerts are Azure resources so they can be managed using the Azure portal or the Azure Resource Manager (ARM). This article shows you how to use the Azure portal to set up alerts on activity log events.

You can receive alerts about operations that were performed on resources in your subscription or about service health events that may impact the health of your resources. An Activity Log Alert monitors the activity log events for the specific subscription the alert is deployed to.

You can configure the alert based on:
* Event Category (for [service health events click here](monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications.md))
- Resource Group
- Resource
- Resource Type
- Operation name
- The level of the notifications (Verbose, Informational, Warning, Error, Critical)
- Status
- Event initiated by

You can also the configure who the alert should be sent to:
* Select an existing Action Group
- Create a new Action Group (that can be later used for future alerts)

You can learn more about [Action Groups here](monitoring-action-groups.md)

You can configure and get information about service health notification alerts using
* [Azure Portal](monitoring-activity-log-alerts.md)
- [Resource Manager templates](monitoring-create-activity-log-alerts-with-resource-manager-template.md)
