# <a name="create-a-job-input-from-a-local-file"></a>Create a job input from a local file

In Media Services v3, when you submit Jobs to process your videos, you have to tell Media Services where to find the input video. The input video can be stored as a Media Service Asset, in which case you create an input asset based on a file (stored locally or in Azure Blob storage). This topic shows how to create a job input from a local file. For a full example, see this [github sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/blob/master/AMSV3Tutorials/UploadEncodeAndStreamFiles/Program.cs).

## <a name="net-sample"></a>.NET sample

The following code shows how to create an input asset and use it as the input for the job. The CreateInputAsset function performs the following actions:

* Creates the Asset 
* Gets a writable [SAS URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1) to the Assetâ€™s [container in storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet?tabs=windows#upload-blobs-to-the-container)
* Uploads the file into the container in storage using the SAS URL
