# <a name="storage-accounts"></a>Storage accounts

When creating a Media Services account, you need to supply the name of an Azure Storage account resource. The specified storage account is attached to your Media Services account. 

You must have one **Primary** storage account and you can have any number of **Secondary** storage accounts associated with your Media Services account. Media Services supports **General-purpose v2** (GPv2) or **General-purpose v1** (GPv1) accounts. 

>[!NOTE]
> Blob only accounts are not allowed as **Primary**. 

We recommend that you use GPv2, so you can take advantage of choosing between hot and cool storage tiers. To learn more about storage accounts, see [Azure Storage account options](../../storage/common/storage-account-options.md).

In Media Services v3, the Storage APIs are used to upload files. To see how to use Storage APIs with Media Services to upload your input files, check out [Create a job input from a local file](job-input-from-local-file-how-to.md). 

> [!Note]
> You should not attempt to change the contents of blob containers that were generated by the Media Services SDK without using Media Services APIs.

To learn how to attach a storage account to your Media Services account, see [Create an account](create-account-cli-quickstart.md).
