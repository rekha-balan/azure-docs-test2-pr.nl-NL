title: Live streaming using Azure Media Services to create multi-bitrate streams | Microsoft Docs
description: 'This topic describes how to set up a Channel that receives a single bitrate live stream from an on-premises encoder and then performs live encoding to adaptive bitrate stream with Media Services. The stream can then be delivered to client playback applications through one or more Streaming Endpoints, using one of the following adaptive streaming protocols: HLS, Smooth Stream, MPEG DASH.'
