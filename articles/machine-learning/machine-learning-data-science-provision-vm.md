Doing data science involves iterating on a sequence of tasks: finding, loading, and pre-processing data, building and testing models, and deploying the models for consumption in intelligent applications. Data scientists use a variety of tools to complete these tasks. It can be quite time consuming to find the appropriate versions of the software, and then download and install them. The Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine can ease this burden by providing a ready-to-use image that can be provisioned on Azure with all several popular tools pre-installed and configured. 

The Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine jump-starts your analytics project. It enables you to work on tasks in various languages including R, Python, SQL, and C#. Visual Studio provides an IDE to develop and test your code that is easy to use. The Azure SDK included in the VM allows you to build your applications using various services on Microsoft’s cloud platform. 

There are no software charges for this data science VM image. You only pay for the Azure usage fees which dependent on the size of the virtual machine you provision. More details on the compute fees can be found in the Pricing details section on the [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsoft-ads/standard-data-science-vm/) page.

## <a name="how-to-access-the-microsoft-data-science-virtual-machine"></a>How to access the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine
Once the VM is created, you can remote desktop into it using the Admin account credentials that you configured in the preceding **Basics** section. 

Once your VM is created and provisioned, you are ready to start using the tools that are installed and configured on it. There are start menu tiles and desktop icons for many of the tools. 

## <a name="how-to-create-a-strong-password-for-jupyter-and-start-the-notebook-server"></a>How to create a strong password for Jupyter and start the notebook server
By default, the Jupyter notebook server is pre-configured but disabled on the VM until you set a Jupyter password. To create a strong password for the Jupyter notebook server installed on the machine, run the following command from a command-prompt on the Data Science Virtual Machine OR double click the desktop shortcut we have provided called **Jupyter Set Password & Start** from a local VM administrator account.

    C:\dsvm\tools\setup\JupyterSetPasswordAndStart.cmd

Follow the messages and choose a strong password when prompted.

The above script will create a password hash and store it in the Jupyter configuration file located at: **C:\ProgramData\jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py** under the parameter name ***c.NotebookApp.password***.

The script will also enable and run the Jupyter server in the background. Jupyter server is created as a windows task in the WIndows Task Scheduler called **Start_IPython_Notebook**.  You may have to wait for a few seconds after setting the password before opening the notebook on your browser. See the section below titled **Jupyter Notebook** on how to access the Jupyter notebook server. 


## <a name="tools-installed-on-the-microsoft-data-science-virtual-machine"></a>Tools installed on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine
### <a name="microsoft-r-server-developer-edition"></a>Microsoft R Server Developer Edition
If you wish to use R for your analytics, the VM has Microsoft R Server Developer edition installed. Microsoft R Server is a broadly deployable enterprise-class analytics platform based on R that is supported, scalable, and secure. Supporting a variety of big data statistics, predictive modeling and machine learning capabilities, R Server supports the full range of analytics – exploration, analysis, visualization, and modeling. By using and extending open source R, Microsoft R Server is fully compatible with R scripts, functions and CRAN packages, to analyze data at enterprise scale. It also addresses the in-memory limitations of Open Source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data. This enables you to run analytics on data much bigger than what fits in main memory.  Visual Studio Community Edition included on the VM contains the R Tools for Visual Studio extension that provides a full IDE for working with R. You can also download and use other IDEs as well such as [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com). 

### <a name="python"></a>Python
For development using Python, Anaconda Python distribution 2.7 and 3.5 has been installed. This distribution contains the base Python along with about 300 of the most popular math, engineering, and data analytics packages. You can use Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) that is installed within the Visual Studio 2015 Community edition or one of the IDEs bundled with Anaconda like IDLE or Spyder. You can launch one of these by searching on the search bar (**Win** + **S** key).

> [!NOTE]
> To point the Python Tools for Visual Studio at Anaconda Python 2.7 and 3.5, you need to create custom environments for each version. To set these environment paths in the Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, navigate to **Tools** -> **Python Tools** -> **Python Environments** and then click **+ Custom**. 
> 
> 

Anaconda Python 2.7 is installed under C:\Anaconda and Anaconda Python 3.5 is installed under c:\Anaconda\envs\py35. See [PTVS documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/wiki/Selecting-and-Installing-Python-Interpreters#hey-i-already-have-an-interpreter-on-my-machine-but-ptvs-doesnt-seem-to-know-about-it) for detailed steps. 

### <a name="jupyter-notebook"></a>Jupyter Notebook
Anaconda distribution also comes with a Jupyter notebook, an environment to share code and analysis. A Jupyter notebook server has been pre-configured with Python 2.7, Python 3.4, Python 3.5, and R kernels. There is a desktop icon named "Jupyter Notebook to launch the browser to access the Notebook server. If you are on the VM via remote desktop, you can also visit [https://localhost:9999/](https://localhost:9999/) to access the Jupyter notebook server when logged in to the VM.

> [!NOTE]
> Continue if you get any certificate warnings. 
> 
> 

We have packaged several sample notebooks in Python and in R. The Jupyter notebooks show how to work with Microsoft R Server, SQL Server 2016 R Services (In-database analytics), Python, Microsoft Cognitive ToolKit (CNTK) for deep learning and other Azure technologies once you log in to Jupyter. You can see the link to the samples on the notebook home page after you authenticate to the Jupyter notebook using the password you created in an earlier step. 

### <a name="visual-studio-2015-community-edition"></a>Visual Studio 2015 Community edition
Visual Studio Community edition installed on the VM. It is a free version of the popular IDE from Microsoft that you can use for evaluation purposes and for small teams. You can check out the licensing terms [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/support/legal/mt171547).  Open Visual Studio by double-clicking the desktop icon or the **Start** menu.
