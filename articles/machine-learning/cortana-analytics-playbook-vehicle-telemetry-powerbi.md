# <a name="vehicle-telemetry-analytics-solution-template-power-bi-dashboard-setup-instructions"></a>Vehicle telemetry analytics solution template Power BI Dashboard setup instructions
This **menu** links to the chapters in this playbook. 

[!INCLUDE [cap-vehicle-telemetry-playbook-selector](../../includes/cap-vehicle-telemetry-playbook-selector.md)]

The Vehicle Telemetry Analytics solution showcases how car dealerships, automobile manufacturers and insurance companies can leverage the capabilities of Cortana Intelligence to gain real-time and predictive insights on vehicle health and driving habits to drive improvements in the area of customer experience, R&D and marketing campaigns. This document contains step by step instructions on how you can configure the Power BI reports and dashboard once the solution is deployed in your subscription. 

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
1. Deploy the Vehicle Telemetry Analytics solution by navigating to [https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Solution/Vehicle-Telemetry-Analytics-9](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Solution/Vehicle-Telemetry-Analytics-9)  
2. [Install Microsoft Power BI Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45331)
3. An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). If you don't have an Azure subscription, get started with Azure free subscription
4. Microsoft Power BI account

## <a name="cortana-intelligence-suite-components"></a>Cortana Intelligence Suite Components
As part of the Vehicle Telemetry Analytics solution template, the following Cortana Intelligence services are deployed in your subscription.

* **Event Hub** for ingesting millions of vehicle telemetry events into Azure.
* **Stream Analytics** for gaining real-time insights on vehicle health and persists that data into long-term storage for richer batch analytics.
* **Machine Learning** for anomaly detection in real-time and batch processing to gain predictive insights.
* **HDInsight** is leveraged to transform data at scale
* **Data Factory** handles orchestration, scheduling, resource management and monitoring of the batch processing pipeline.

**Power BI** gives this solution a rich dashboard for real-time data and predictive analytics visualizations. 

The solution uses two different data sources: **Simulated vehicle signals and diagnostic dataset** and **vehicle catalog**.

A vehicle telematics simulator is included as part of this solution. It emits diagnostic information and signals corresponding to the state of the vehicle and driving pattern at a given point in time. 

The Vehicle Catalog is a reference dataset containing VIN to model mapping

### <a name="setup-power-bi-real-time-dashboard"></a>Setup Power BI Real-Time Dashboard

**Start the real-time dashboard application** Once the deployment is completed, you should follow the Manual Operation Instructions

* Download real-time dashboard application RealtimeDashboardApp.zip, and unzip it.
*  In the unzipped folder, open app config file 'RealtimeDashboardApp.exe.config', replace appSettings for Eventhub, Blob Storage, and ML service connections with the values in the Manual Operation Instructions, and save your changes.
* Run application RealtimeDashboardApp.exe. A login window will pop up, provide your valid PowerBI credentials and click the **Accept** button. Then the app will start to run.

* Login to PowerBI website, and create real-time dashboard.

Now, you are ready to configure the Power BI dashboard with rich visualizations to gain real-time and predictive insights on vehicle health and driving habits. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to create all the reports and configure the dashboard. 

### <a name="configure-power-bi-reports"></a>Configure Power BI reports
The real-time reports and the dashboard take about 30-45 minutes to complete. Browse to [http://powerbi.com](http://powerbi.com) and login.
