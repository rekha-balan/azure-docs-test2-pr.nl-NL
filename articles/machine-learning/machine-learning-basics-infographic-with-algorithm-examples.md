[Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) comes with a large library of algorithms for predictive analytics. The infographic identifies four popular families of algorithms - regression, anomaly detection, clustering, and classification - and provides links to working examples in the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/). The Gallery contains example experiments and tutorials that demonstrate how these algorithms can be applied in many real-world solutions.
