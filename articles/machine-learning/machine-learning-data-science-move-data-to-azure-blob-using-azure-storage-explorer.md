# <a name="move-data-to-and-from-azure-blob-storage-using-azure-storage-explorer"></a>Move data to and from Azure Blob Storage using Azure Storage Explorer
Azure Storage Explorer is a free tool from Microsoft that allows you to work with Azure Storage data on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This topic describes how to use it to upload and download data from Azure blob storage. The tool can be downloaded from [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/).

[!INCLUDE [blob-storage-tool-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-blob-storage-tool-selector.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using VM that was set up with the scripts provided by [Data Science Virtual machines in Azure](machine-learning-data-science-virtual-machines.md), then Azure Storage Explorer is already installed on the VM.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> For a complete introduction to Azure blob storage, refer to [Azure Blob Basics](../storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs.md) and [Azure Blob Service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179376.aspx).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
This document assumes that you have an Azure subscription, a storage account, and the corresponding storage key for that account. Before uploading/downloading data, you must know your Azure storage account name and account key. 

* To set up an Azure subscription, see [Free one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* For instructions on creating a storage account and for getting account and key information, see [About Azure storage accounts](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md). Make a note the access key for your storage account as you need this key to connect to the account with the Azure Storage Explorer tool.
* The Azure Storage Explorer tool can be downloaded from [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/). Accept the defaults during install.

3. To bring up the **Connect to Azure Storage** wizard, select the **Connect to Azure storage** icon. ![Connect to Azure storage](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/machine-learning/media/machine-learning-data-science-move-data-to-azure-blob-using-azure-storage-explorer/connect-to-azure-storage-1.png)
4. Enter the access key from your Azure storage account on the **Connect to Azure Storage** wizard and then **Next**. ![Connect to Azure storage](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/machine-learning/media/machine-learning-data-science-move-data-to-azure-blob-using-azure-storage-explorer/connect-to-azure-storage-2.png)
5. Enter storage account name in the **Account name** box and then select **Next**. ![Attach external storage](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/machine-learning/media/machine-learning-data-science-move-data-to-azure-blob-using-azure-storage-explorer/attach-external-storage.png)
