# <a name="python-packages-for-azure-machine-learning"></a>Python packages for Azure Machine Learning

Learn about the proprietary Python packages from Microsoft for Azure Machine Learning. You can use these libraries and functions in combination with other open-source or third-party packages, but to use the proprietary packages, your Python code must run against a service or on a computer that provides the interpreters.

The Azure Machine Learning packages are **Python pip-installable extensions for Azure Machine Learning** that enable data scientists and AI developers to quickly build and deploy highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models for various domains.

## <a name="azure-ml-package-for-computer-vision"></a>Azure ML Package for Computer Vision

With Azure ML Package for Computer Vision, you can build, fine-tune, and deploy deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and image similarity.

Try these next steps for this package:
1. [Download](https://aka.ms/aml-packages/vision/download) the package.
1. Read the [install docs](https://aka.ms/aml-packages/vision).
1. [Build and deploy a computer vision model](how-to-build-deploy-image-classification-models.md) with a Jupyter notebook.
1. Explore the package [reference documentation](https://aka.ms/aml-packages/vision).

<a name="amlrealtimeai"></a>
## <a name="amlrealtimeai-fpga-acceleration"></a>amlrealtimeai (FPGA acceleration)

With Azure Machine Learning Hardware Acceleration package, data scientists and AI developers can featurize images with a quantized version of ResNet 50, train classifiers based on those features, and then deploy models to an [field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)](concept-accelerate-with-fpgas.md) on Azure for ultra-low latency inferencing.

Try these next steps for this package:
1. [Download](https://aka.ms/aml-real-time-ai-package) the package.
1. Read the [install docs](reference-fpga-package-overview.md).
1. [Deploy a model to an FPGA](how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md).
