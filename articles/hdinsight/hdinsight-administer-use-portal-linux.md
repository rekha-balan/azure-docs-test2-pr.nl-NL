## <a name="delete-clusters"></a>Delete clusters
Delete a cluster will not delete the default storage account or any linked storage accounts. You can re-create the cluster by using the same storage accounts and the same metastores. It is recommended to use a new default Blob container when you re-create the cluster.

1. Sign in to the [Portal][azure-portal].
2. Click **HDInsight Clusters** from the left menu. If you don't see **HDInsight Clusters**, click **More services** first.
3. Click the cluster that you want to delete.
4. Click **Delete** from the top menu, and then follow the instructions.

See also [Pause/shut down clusters](#pauseshut-down-clusters).

## <a name="scale-clusters"></a>Scale clusters
The cluster scaling feature allows you to change the number of worker nodes used by a cluster that is running in Azure HDInsight without having to re-create the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Only clusters with HDInsight version 3.1.3 or higher are supported. If you are unsure of the version of your cluster, you can check the Properties page.  See [List and show clusters](#list-and-show-clusters).
>
>

The impact of changing the number of data nodes for each type of cluster supported by HDInsight:

* Hadoop

    You can seamlessly increase the number of worker nodes in a Hadoop cluster that is running without impacting any pending or running jobs. New jobs can also be submitted while the operation is in progress. Failures in a scaling operation are gracefully handled so that the cluster is always left in a functional state.

    When a Hadoop cluster is scaled down by reducing the number of data nodes, some of the services in the cluster are restarted. This causes all running and pending jobs to fail at the completion of the scaling operation. You can, however, resubmit the jobs once the operation is complete.
* HBase

    You can seamlessly add or remove nodes to your HBase cluster while it is running. Regional Servers are automatically balanced within a few minutes of completing the scaling operation. However, you can also manually balance the regional servers by logging into the headnode of cluster and running the following commands from a command prompt window:

        >pushd %HBASE_HOME%\bin
        >hbase shell
        >balancer

    For more information on using the HBase shell, see []
* Storm

    You can seamlessly add or remove data nodes to your Storm cluster while it is running. But after a successful completion of the scaling operation, you will need to rebalance the topology.

    Rebalancing can be accomplished in two ways:

  * Storm web UI
  * Command-line interface (CLI) tool

    Please refer to the [Apache Storm documentation](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Understanding-the-parallelism-of-a-Storm-topology.html) for more details.

    The Storm web UI is available on the HDInsight cluster:

    ![HDInsight Storm scale rebalance](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/hdinsight/media/hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux/hdinsight.portal.scale.cluster.storm.rebalance.png)

    Here is an example how to use the CLI command to rebalance the Storm topology:

        ## Reconfigure the topology "mytopology" to use 5 worker processes,
        ## the spout "blue-spout" to use 3 executors, and
        ## the bolt "yellow-bolt" to use 10 executors
        $ storm rebalance mytopology -n 5 -e blue-spout=3 -e yellow-bolt=10

**To scale clusters**

1. Sign in to the [Portal][azure-portal].
2. Click **HDInsight Clusters** from the left menu.
3. Click the cluster you want to scale.
3. Click **Scale Cluster**.
4. Enter **Number of Worker nodes**. The limit on the number of cluster node varies among Azure subscriptions. You can contact billing support to increase the limit.  The cost information will reflect the changes you have made to the number of nodes.

    ![HDInsight hadoop hbase storm spark scale](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/hdinsight/media/hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux/hdinsight.portal.scale.cluster.png)

## <a name="pauseshut-down-clusters"></a>Pause/shut down clusters

Most of Hadoop jobs are batch jobs that are only run occasionally. For most Hadoop clusters, there are large periods of time that the cluster is not being used for processing. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it is not in use.
You are also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it is not in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they are not in use.

There are many ways you can program the process:

* User Azure Data Factory. See [Create on-demand Linux-based Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using Azure Data Factory](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf.md) for creating on-demand HDInsight linked services.
* Use Azure PowerShell.  See [Analyze flight delay data](hdinsight-analyze-flight-delay-data.md).
* Use Azure CLI. See [Manage HDInsight clusters using Azure CLI](hdinsight-administer-use-command-line.md).
* Use HDInsight .NET SDK. See [Submit Hadoop jobs](hdinsight-submit-hadoop-jobs-programmatically.md).

For the pricing information, see [HDInsight pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/hdinsight/). To delete a cluster from the Portal, see [Delete clusters](#delete-clusters)

## <a name="change-passwords"></a>Change passwords
An HDInsight cluster can have two user accounts. The HDInsight cluster user account (A.K.A. HTTP user account) and the SSH user account are created during the creation process. You can the Ambari web UI to change the cluster user account username and password, and script actions to change the SSH user account

### <a name="change-the-cluster-user-password"></a>Change the cluster user password
You can use the Ambari Web UI to change the Cluster user password. To log into Ambari, you must use the existing cluster username and password.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the cluster user (admin) password, this may cause script actions ran against this cluster to fail. If you have any persisted script actions that target worker nodes, these may fail when you add nodes to the cluster through resize operations. For more information on script actions, see [Customize HDInsight clusters using script actions](hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md).

>

1. Sign in to the Ambari Web UI using the HDInsight cluster user credentials. The default username is **admin**. The URL is **https://&lt;HDInsight Cluster Name>azurehdinsight.net**.
2. Click **Admin** from the top menu, and then click "Manage Ambari".
3. From the left menu, click **Users**.
4. Click **Admin**.
5. Click **Change Password**.

Ambari then changes the password on all nodes in the cluster.

### <a name="change-the-ssh-user-password"></a>Change the SSH user password
1. Using a text editor, save the following text as a file named **changepassword.sh**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must use an editor that uses LF as the line ending. If the editor uses CRLF, then the script will not work.
   >
   >

        #! /bin/bash
        USER=$1
        PASS=$2

        usermod --password $(echo $PASS | openssl passwd -1 -stdin) $USER
2. Upload the file to a storage location that can be accessed from HDInsight using an HTTP or HTTPS address. For example, a public file store such as OneDrive or Azure Blob storage. Save the URI (HTTP or HTTPS address,) to the file, as this is needed in the next step.
3. From the Azure portal, click **HDInsight Clusters**.
4. Click your HDInsight cluster.
4. Click **Script Actions**.
4. From the **Script Actions** blade, select **Submit New**. When the **Submit script action** blade appears, enter the following information.

   | Field | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Name |Change ssh password |
   | Bash script URI |The URI to the changepassword.sh file |
   | Nodes (Head, Worker, Nimbus, Supervisor, Zookeeper, etc.) |✓ for all node types listed |
   | Parameters |Enter the SSH user name and then the new password. There should be one space between the user name and the password. |
   | Persist this script action ... |Leave this field unchecked. |
5. Select **Create** to apply the script. Once the script finishes, you will be able to connect to the cluster using SSH with the new password.

## <a name="grantrevoke-access"></a>Grant/revoke access
HDInsight clusters have the following HTTP web services (all of these services have RESTful endpoints):

* ODBC
* JDBC
* Ambari
* Oozie
* Templeton

By default, these services are granted for access. You can revoke/grant the access using [Azure CLI](hdinsight-administer-use-command-line.md#enabledisable-http-access-for-a-cluster) and [Azure PowerShell](hdinsight-administer-use-powershell.md#grantrevoke-access).

## <a name="find-the-subscription-id"></a>Find the subscription ID

**To find your Azure subscription IDs**
