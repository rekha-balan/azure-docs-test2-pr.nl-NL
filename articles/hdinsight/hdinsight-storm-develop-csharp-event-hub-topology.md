# <a name="process-events-from-azure-event-hubs-with-storm-on-hdinsight-c"></a>Process events from Azure Event Hubs with Storm on HDInsight (C#)

Azure Event Hubs allows you to process massive amounts of data from websites, apps, and devices. The Event Hubs spout makes it easy to use Apache Storm on HDInsight to analyze this data in real time. You can also write data to Event Hubs from Storm by using the Event Hubs bolt.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Visual Studio templates installed with HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio to create two topologies that work with Azure Event Hubs.

* **EventHubWriter**: Randomly generates data and writes it to Event Hubs
* **EventHubReader**: Reads data from Event Hubs and logs the data to the Storm logs

> [!NOTE]
> For a Java version of this project, see [Process events from Azure Event Hubs with Storm on HDInsight (Java)](hdinsight-storm-develop-java-event-hub-topology.md).

## <a name="scpnet"></a>SCP.NET

These projects use SCP.NET, a NuGet package that makes it easy to create C# topologies and components for use with Storm on HDInsight.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the steps in this document rely on a Windows development environment with Visual Studio, the compiled project can be submitted to a Storm on HDInsight cluster that uses Linux. __Only Linux-based clusters created after 10/28/2016 support SCP.NET topologies.__

### <a name="cluster-versioning"></a>Cluster versioning

The Microsoft.SCP.Net.SDK NuGet package used by your project must match the major version of Storm installed on HDInsight. Storm on HDInsight versions 3.3 and 3.4 use Storm version 0.10.x, so you must use SCP.NET version 0.10.x.x with these clusters. HDInsight 3.5 uses Storm 1.0.x., so you must use SCP.NET version 1.0.x.x with this cluster version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Linux is the only operating system used on HDInsight version 3.4 or greater. For more information, see [HDInsight Deprecation on Windows](hdinsight-component-versioning.md#hdi-version-33-nearing-deprecation-date).

HDInsight 3.4 and greater use Mono to run C# topologies. Most things work with Mono. However you should check the [Mono Compatibility](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/compatibility/) document for potential incompatibilities.

C# topologies must also target .NET 4.5.

## <a name="how-to-work-with-event-hubs"></a>How to work with Event Hubs

Microsoft provides a set of Java components that can be used to communicate with Azure Event Hubs from a Storm topology. You can find the jar file that contains the latest version of these components at [https://github.com/hdinsight/hdinsight-storm-examples/blob/master/lib/eventhubs/](https://github.com/hdinsight/hdinsight-storm-examples/blob/master/lib/eventhubs/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the components are written in Java, you can easily use them from a C# topology.

The components following components are used in this example:

* __EventHubSpout__: Reads data from Event Hubs.
* __EventHubBolt__: Writes data to Event Hubs.
* __EventHubSpoutConfig__: Used to configure EventHubSpout.
* __EventHubBoltConfig__: Used to configure EventHubBolt.
* __UnicodeEventDataScheme__: Used to configure the spout to use UTF-8 encoding when reading from Event Hubs. The default encoding is String.

### <a name="example-spout-usage"></a>Example Spout usage

SCP.NET provides methods for adding an EventHubSpout to your topology. These methods make it easier to add a spout than using the generic methods for adding a Java component. The following example demonstrates how to create a spout using the __SetEventHubSpout__ and EventHubSpoutConfig methods provided by SCP.NET:

```csharp
topologyBuilder.SetEventHubSpout(
    "EventHubSpout",
    new EventHubSpoutConfig(
        // the shared access signature name and key used to read the data
        ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubSharedAccessKeyName"],
        ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubSharedAccessKey"],
        // The namespace that contains the Event Hub to read from
        ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubNamespace"],
        // The Event Hub name to read from
        ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubEntityPath"],
        // The number of partitions in the Event Hub
        eventHubPartitions),
    // Parallelism hint for this component. Should be set to the partition count.
    eventHubPartitions);
```

The previous example creates a new spout component named __EventHubSpout__, and configures it to communicate with an Event Hub. The parallelism hint for the component is set to the number of partitions in the Event Hub. This setting allows Storm to create an instance of the component for each partition.

> [!WARNING]
> As of January 1st, 2017, using the SetEventHubSpout and EventHubSpoutConfig methods create a spout that uses String encoding when reading data from Event Hubs.

You can also use the generic JavaComponentConstructor method when creating a spout. The following example demonstrates how to create a spout using the JavaComponentConstructor method. It also demonstrates how to configure the spout to read data using a UTF-8 encoding instead of String.

```csharp
// Create an instance of UnicodeEventDataScheme
var schemeConstructor = new JavaComponentConstructor("com.microsoft.eventhubs.spout.UnicodeEventDataScheme");
// Create an instance of EventHubSpoutConfig
var eventHubSpoutConfig = new JavaComponentConstructor(
    "com.microsoft.eventhubs.spout.EventHubSpoutConfig",
    new List<Tuple<string, object>>()
    {
        // the shared access signature name and key used to read the data
        Tuple.Create<string, object>(JavaComponentConstructor.JAVA_LANG_STRING, ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubSharedAccessKeyName"]),
        Tuple.Create<string, object>(JavaComponentConstructor.JAVA_LANG_STRING, ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubSharedAccessKey"]),
        // The namespace that contains the Event Hub to read from
        Tuple.Create<string, object>(JavaComponentConstructor.JAVA_LANG_STRING, ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubNamespace"]),
        // The Event Hub name to read from
        Tuple.Create<string, object>(JavaComponentConstructor.JAVA_LANG_STRING, ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubEntityPath"]),
        // The number of partitions in the Event Hub
        Tuple.Create<string, object>("int", eventHubPartitions),
        // The encoding scheme to use when reading
        Tuple.Create<string, object>("com.microsoft.eventhubs.spout.IEventDataScheme", schemeConstructor)
    }
    );
// Create an instance of the spout
var eventHubSpout = new JavaComponentConstructor(
    "com.microsoft.eventhubs.spout.EventHubSpout",
    new List<Tuple<string, object>>()
    {
        Tuple.Create<string, object>("com.microsoft.eventhubs.spout.EventHubSpoutConfig", eventHubSpoutConfig)
    }
    );
// Set the spout in the topology
topologyBuilder.SetJavaSpout("EventHubSpout", eventHubSpout, eventHubPartitions);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> UnicodeEventDataScheme is only available in the 9.5 version of the Event Hub components, which is available from [https://github.com/hdinsight/hdinsight-storm-examples/blob/master/lib/eventhubs/](https://github.com/hdinsight/hdinsight-storm-examples/blob/master/lib/eventhubs/).

### <a name="example-bolt-usage"></a>Example Bolt usage

Use the JavaComponmentConstructor method to create an instance of the bolt. The following example demonstrates how to create and configure a new instance of the EventHubBolt:

```csharp
//Create constructor for the Java bolt
JavaComponentConstructor constructor =
    // Use a Clojure expression to create the EventHubBoltCOnfig
    JavaComponentConstructor.CreateFromClojureExpr(
        String.Format(@"(org.apache.storm.eventhubs.bolt.EventHubBolt. (org.apache.storm.eventhubs.bolt.EventHubBoltConfig. " +
        @"""{0}"" ""{1}"" ""{2}"" ""{3}"" ""{4}"" {5}))",
    // The policy name and key used to read from Event Hubs
    ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubPolicyName"],
    ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubPolicyKey"],
    // The namespace that contains the Event Hub
    ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubNamespace"],
    "servicebus.windows.net", //suffix for the namespace fqdn
    // The Evetn Hub Name)
    ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EventHubName"],
    "true"));

//Set the bolt
topologyBuilder.SetJavaBolt(
        "EventHubBolt",
        constructor,
        partitionCount). //Parallelism hint uses partition count
    shuffleGrouping("Spout"); //Consume data from spout
```

> [!NOTE]
> This example uses a Clojure expression passed as a string, instead of using JavaComponentConstructor to create an EventHubBoltConfig as the Spout example did. Either method works. Use the method that feels best to you.
