This article explains how to use the Resource Manager REST API with Resource Manager templates to deploy your resources to Azure.

Your template can be either a local file or an external file that is available through a URI. When your template resides in a storage account, you can restrict access to the template and provide a shared access signature (SAS) token during deployment.

[!INCLUDE [resource-manager-deployments](../../includes/resource-manager-deployments.md)]

## <a name="deploy-with-the-rest-api"></a>Deploy with the REST API
1. Set [common parameters and headers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/index), including authentication tokens.
2. If you do not have an existing resource group, create a resource group. Provide your subscription ID, the name of the new resource group, and location that you need for your solution. For more information, see [Create a resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resourcegroups#ResourceGroups_CreateOrUpdate).
   
        PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<YourSubscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<YourResourceGroupName>?api-version=2015-01-01
          <common headers>
          {
            "location": "West US",
            "tags": {
               "tagname1": "tagvalue1"
            }
          }
3. Validate your deployment before executing it by running the [Validate a template deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/deployments#Deployments_Validate) operation. When testing the deployment, provide parameters exactly as you would when executing the deployment (shown in the next step).
4. Create a deployment. Provide your subscription ID, the name of the resource group, the name of the deployment, and a link to your template. For information about the template file, see [Parameter file](#parameter-file). For more information about the REST API to create a resource group, see [Create a template deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/deployments#Deployments_CreateOrUpdate). Notice the **mode** is set to **Incremental**. To run a complete deployment, set **mode** to **Complete**. Be careful when using the complete mode as you can inadvertently delete resources that are not in your template.
   
        PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<YourSubscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<YourResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/<YourDeploymentName>?api-version=2015-01-01
          <common headers>
          {
            "properties": {
              "templateLink": {
                "uri": "http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/templates/template.json",
                "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0"
              },
              "mode": "Incremental",
              "parametersLink": {
                "uri": "http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/templates/parameters.json",
                "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0"
              }
            }
          }
   
      If you want to log response content, request content, or both, include **debugSetting** in the request.
   
        "debugSetting": {
          "detailLevel": "requestContent, responseContent"
        }
   
      You can set up your storage account to use a shared access signature (SAS) token. For more information, see [Delegating Access with a Shared Access Signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/fileservices/delegating-access-with-a-shared-access-signature).
5. Get the status of the template deployment. For more information, see [Get information about a template deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/deployments#Deployments_Get).
   
          GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<YourSubscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<YourResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/<YourDeploymentName>?api-version=2015-01-01
           <common headers>
