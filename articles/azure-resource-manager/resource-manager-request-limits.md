# <a name="throttling-resource-manager-requests"></a>Throttling Resource Manager requests
For each subscription and tenant, Resource Manager limits read requests to 15,000 per hour and write requests to 1,200 per hour. If your application or script reaches these limits, you need to throttle your requests. This topic shows you how to determine the remaining requests you have before reaching the limit, and how to respond when you have reached the limit.

When you reach the limit, you receive the HTTP status code **429 Too many requests**.

The number of requests is scoped to either your subscription or your tenant. If you have multiple, concurrent applications making requests in your subscription, the requests from those applications are added together to determine the number of remaining requests.

Subscription scoped requests are ones the involve passing your subscription id, such as retrieving the resource groups in your subscription. Tenant scoped requests do not include your subscription id, such as retrieving valid Azure locations.

## <a name="remaining-requests"></a>Remaining requests
You can determine the number of remaining requests by examining response headers. Each request includes values for the number of remaining read and write requests. The following table describes the response headers you can examine for those values:

| Response header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-reads |Subscription scoped reads remaining |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-writes |Subscription scoped writes remaining |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-tenant-reads |Tenant scoped reads remaining |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-tenant-writes |Tenant scoped writes remaining |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-resource-requests |Subscription scoped resource type requests remaining.<br /><br />This header value is only returned if a service has overridden the default limit. Resource Manager adds this value instead of the subscription reads or writes. |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-resource-entities-read |Subscription scoped resource type collection requests remaining.<br /><br />This header value is only returned if a service has overridden the default limit. This value provides the number of remaining collection requests (list resources). |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-tenant-resource-requests |Tenant scoped resource type requests remaining.<br /><br />This header is only added for requests at tenant level, and only if a service has overridden the default limit. Resource Manager adds this value instead of the tenant reads or writes. |
| x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-tenant-resource-entities-read |Tenant scoped resource type collection requests remaining.<br /><br />This header is only added for requests at tenant level, and only if a service has overridden the default limit. |

## <a name="retrieving-the-header-values"></a>Retrieving the header values
Retrieving these header values in your code or script is no different than retrieving any header value. 

For example, in **C#**, you retrieve the header value from an **HttpWebResponse** object named **response** with the following code:

```cs
response.Headers.GetValues("x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-reads").GetValue(0)
```

In **PowerShell**, you retrieve the header value from an Invoke-WebRequest operation.

```powershell
$r = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{guid}/resourcegroups?api-version=2016-09-01 -Method GET -Headers $authHeaders
$r.Headers["x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-reads"]
```

Or, if want to see the remaining requests for debugging, you can provide the **-Debug** parameter on your **PowerShell** cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmResourceGroup -Debug
```

Which returns many values, including the following response value:

```powershell
...
DEBUG: ============================ HTTP RESPONSE ============================

Status Code:
OK

Headers:
Pragma                        : no-cache
x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-reads: 14999
...
```

In **Azure CLI**, you retrieve the header value by using the more verbose option.

```azurecli
azure group list -vv --json
```

Which returns many values, including the following object:

```azurecli
...
silly: returnObject
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "header": {
    "cache-control": "no-cache",
    "pragma": "no-cache",
    "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    "expires": "-1",
    "x-ms-ratelimit-remaining-subscription-reads": "14998",
    ...
```

## <a name="waiting-before-sending-next-request"></a>Waiting before sending next request
When you reach the request limit, Resource Manager returns the **429** HTTP status code and a **Retry-After** value in the header. The **Retry-After** value specifies the number of seconds your application should wait (or sleep) before sending the next request. If you send a request before the retry value has elapsed, your request is not processed and a new retry value is returned.
