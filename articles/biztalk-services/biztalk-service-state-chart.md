# <a name="what-you-can-and-cant-do-using-the-biztalk-service-state"></a>What you can and can't do using the BizTalk Service state
Depending on the current state of the BizTalk service, there are operations that you can or cannot perform on the BizTalk service.

For example, you provision a new BizTalk service in the Azure classic portal. When it completes successfully, the BizTalk service is in `active` state. In the active state, you can stop, suspend, and delete the BizTalk service. If you stop the BizTalk service, and stop fails, then the BizTalk service goes to a `StopFailed` state. In the `StopFailed` state, you can restart the BizTalk service. If you try an operation that is not allowed, like resume, the following error occurs:

`Operation not allowed`

The following tables list the operations or actions that can be done when the BizTalk Service is in a specific state. A ✔ means the operation is allowed while in that state. A blank entry means the operation cannot be performed while in that state.
