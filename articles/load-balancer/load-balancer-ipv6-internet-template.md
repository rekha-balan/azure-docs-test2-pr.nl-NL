> [!NOTE]
> ICMP for both IPv4 and IPv6 is blocked in the Azure network. As a result, ICMP tools like ping always fail. To test connectivity, use a TCP alternative such as TCPing or the PowerShell Test-NetConnection cmdlet. Note that the IP addresses shown in the diagram are examples of values that you might see. Since the IPv6 addresses are assigned dynamically, the addresses you receive will differ and can vary by region. Also, it is common for the public IPv6 address on the load balancer to start with a different prefix than the private IPv6 addresses in the back-end pool.
