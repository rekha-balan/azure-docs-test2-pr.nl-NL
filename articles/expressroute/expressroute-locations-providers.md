The tables in this article provide information on ExpressRoute connectivity providers, ExpressRoute geographical coverage, Microsoft cloud services supported over ExpressRoute, and ExpressRoute System Integrators (SIs).

## <a name="partners"></a>ExpressRoute connectivity providers
ExpressRoute is supported across all Azure regions and locations. The following map provides a list of Azure regions and ExpressRoute locations. ExpressRoute locations refer to those where Microsoft peers with several service providers.

![Location map][0]

You will have access to Azure services across all regions within a geopolitical region if you connected to at least one ExpressRoute location within the geopolitical region. 

### <a name="azure-regions-to-expressroute-locations-within-a-geopolitical-region"></a>Azure regions to ExpressRoute locations within a geopolitical region
The following table provides a map of Azure regions to ExpressRoute locations within a geopolitical region.

| **Geopolitical region** | **Azure regions** | **ExpressRoute locations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **North America** |East US, West US, East US 2, West US 2, Central US, South Central US, North Central US, West Central US, Canada Central, Canada East |Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Washington DC, Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto |
| **South America** |Brazil South |Sao Paulo |
| **Europe** |North Europe, West Europe, UK West, UK South |Amsterdam, Dublin, London, Newport(Wales), Paris |
| **Asia** |East Asia, Southeast Asia |Hong Kong, Singapore |
| **Japan** |Japan West, Japan East |Osaka, Tokyo |
| **Australia** |Australia Southeast, Australia East |Melbourne, Sydney |
| **India** |India West, India Central, India South |Chennai, Mumbai |
| **South Korea** |Korea Central, Korea South |Busan, Seoul |

### <a name="regions-and-geopolitical-boundaries-for-national-clouds"></a>Regions and geopolitical boundaries for national clouds
The table below provides information on regions and geopolitical boundaries for national clouds.

| **Geopolitical region** | **Azure regions** | **ExpressRoute locations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **US Government cloud** |US Gov Iowa, US Gov Virginia, US DoD Central, US DoD East  |Chicago, Dallas, New York, Silicon Valley, Washington DC |
| **China** |China North, China East |Beijing, Shanghai |
| **Germany** |Germany Central, Germany East |Berlin, Frankfurt |

Connectivity across geopolitical regions is not supported on the standard ExpressRoute SKU. You will need to enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on to support global connectivity. Connectivity to national cloud environments is not supported. You can work with your connectivity provider if such a need arises.

## <a name="locations"></a>Connectivity provider locations

The following table shows connectivity locations and the service providers for each location. If you want to view service providers and the locations for which they can provide service, see [Locations by service provider](expressroute-locations.md#locations).

## <a name="c1partners"></a>Connectivity through service providers not listed
If your connectivity provider is not listed in previous sections, you can still create a connection.

* Check with your connectivity provider to see if they are connected to any of the exchanges in the table above. You can check the following links to gather more information about services offered by exchange providers. Several connectivity providers are already connected to Ethernet exchanges.
  * [Cologix](http://www.cologix.com/)

* Have your connectivity provider extend your network to the peering location of choice.
  * Ensure that your connectivity provider extends your connectivity in a highly available manner so that there are no single points of failure.
* Order an ExpressRoute circuit with the exchange as your connectivity provider to connect to Microsoft.
  * Follow steps in [Create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) to set up connectivity.
