The Bing Web Search SDK is available in Python, Node.js, C#, and Java. Code samples, prerequisites, and build instructions are provided on GitHub. The following scenarios are covered:

* Query a single word and print the name and URL of the first result for web pages, images, news articles, and videos.
* Query a phrase, verify the number of results, and print out the name and URL of first result.
* Query a search term with response filters set to `news` and print the details of news results.
* Query a search term with `answerCount` and `promote` parameters, then print details of results.
