The Microsoft Translator API seamlessly integrates with your site or app to translate content. It also offers the unique ability to improve the accuracy of the delivered translations through the use of the Collaborative Translations Framework (CTF), allowing users to recommend alternative translations to those provided by Translatorâ€™s automatic translation engine. It can also be customized with your pre-translated data through the [Microsoft Translator Hub] (http://hub.microsofttranslator.com/). The Translator Web Widget is an easy to integrate one-stop-solution to add automatic translation support to your webpage, blog, or SharePoint site. This free widget will allow you to add this support without the need for any particular coding. 

Code samples demonstrating use of the Speech Translation API are available from the [Microsoft Translator Github site](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator).
