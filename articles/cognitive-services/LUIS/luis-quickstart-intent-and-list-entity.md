# <a name="tutorial-4-add-list-entity"></a>Tutorial: 4. Add list entity
In this tutorial, create an app that demonstrates how to get data that matches a predefined list.

## <a name="before-you-begin"></a>Before you begin
If you don't have the Human Resources app from the [regex entity](luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity.md) tutorial, [import](luis-how-to-start-new-app.md#import-new-app) the JSON into a new app in the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) website. The app to import is found in the [LUIS-Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/blob/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/custom-domain-regex-HumanResources.json) Github repository.

If you want to keep the original Human Resources app, clone the version on the [Settings](luis-how-to-manage-versions.md#clone-a-version) page, and name it `list`. Cloning is a great way to play with various LUIS features without affecting the original version. 

## <a name="purpose-of-the-list-entity"></a>Purpose of the list entity
This app predicts utterances about moving an employee from one building to a different building. This app uses a list entity to extract an employee. The employee can be referred to using name, phone number, email, or U.S. federal social security number. 

A list entity can hold many items with synonyms for each item. For a small to medium size company, the list entity is used to extract the employee information. 

The canonical name for each item is the employee number. For this domain, examples of the synonyms are: 

|Synonym purpose|Synonym value|
|--|--|
|Name|John W. Smith|
|Email address|john.w.smith@mycompany.com|
|Phone extension|x12345|
|Personal mobile phone number|425-555-1212|
|U.S. federal social security number|123-45-6789|

A list entity is a good choice for this type of data when:

* The data values are a known set.
* The set doesn't exceed the maximum LUIS [boundaries](luis-boundaries.md) for this entity type.
* The text in the utterance is an exact match with a synonym. 

LUIS extracts the employee in such as way that a standard order to move the employee can be created by the client application.
<!--
## Example utterances
Simple example utterances for a `MoveEmployee` inent:

```
move John W. Smith from B-1234 to H-4452
mv john.w.smith@mycompany from office b-1234 to office h-4452

```
-->

## <a name="add-moveemployee-intent"></a>Add MoveEmployee intent

1. Make sure your Human Resources app is in the **Build** section of LUIS. You can change to this section by selecting **Build** on the top, right menu bar. 

2. Select **Create new intent**. 

3. Enter `MoveEmployee` in the pop-up dialog box then select **Done**. 

    ![Screenshot of create new intent dialog with](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/hr-create-new-intent-ddl.png)

4. Add example utterances to the intent.

    |Example utterances|
    |--|
    |move John W. Smith from B-1234 to H-4452|
    |mv john.w.smith@mycompany.com from office b-1234 to office h-4452|
    |shift x12345 to h-1234 tomorrow|
    |place 425-555-1212 in HH-2345|
    |move 123-45-6789 from A-4321 to J-23456|
    |mv Jill Jones from D-2345 to J-23456|
    |shift jill-jones@mycompany.com to M-12345|
    |x23456 to M-12345|
    |425-555-0000 to h-4452|
    |234-56-7891 to hh-2345|

## <a name="create-an-employee-list-entity"></a>Create an employee list entity
Now that the **MoveEmployee** intent has utterances, LUIS needs to understand what an employee is. 

1. Select **Entities** in the left panel.

2. Select **Create new entity**.

3. In the entity pop-up dialog, enter `Employee` for the entity name, and  **List** for entity type. Select **Done**.

4. On the Employee entity page, enter `Employee-24612` as the new value.

    [![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/hr-emp1-value.png "Screenshot of entering value")](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/hr-emp1-value.png#lightbox)

5. For Synonyms, add the following values:

    |Synonym purpose|Synonym value|
    |--|--|
    |Name|John W. Smith|
    |Email address|john.w.smith@mycompany.com|
    |Phone extension|x12345|
    |Personal mobile phone number|425-555-1212|
    |U.S. federal social security number|123-45-6789|

    [![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/hr-emp1-synonyms.png "Screenshot of entering synonyms")](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/hr-emp1-synonyms.png#lightbox)

6. Enter the `Employee-45612` as a new value.

7. For Synonyms, add the following values:

    |Synonym purpose|Synonym value|
    |--|--|
    |Name|Jill Jones|
    |Email address|jill-jones@mycompany.com|
    |Phone extension|x23456|
    |Personal mobile phone number|425-555-0000|
    |U.S. federal social security number|234-56-7891|

## <a name="train-the-luis-app"></a>Train the LUIS app

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Train steps](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-train.md)]

## <a name="publish-the-app-to-get-the-endpoint-url"></a>Publish the app to get the endpoint URL

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Publish steps](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-publish.md)]

## <a name="query-the-endpoint-with-a-different-utterance"></a>Query the endpoint with a different utterance

1. [!INCLUDE [LUIS How to get endpoint first step](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-get-endpoint.md)] 

2. Go to the end of the URL in the address and enter `shift 123-45-6789 from Z-1242 to T-54672`. The last querystring parameter is `q`, the utterance **q**uery. This utterance is not the same as any of the labeled utterances so it is a good test and should return the `MoveEmployee` intent with `Employee` extracted.

  The employee was found and returned as type `Employee` with a resolution value of `Employee-24612`.

## <a name="where-is-the-natural-language-processing-in-the-list-entity"></a>Where is the natural language processing in the List entity? 
Because the list entity is an exact text match, it doesn't rely on natural language processing (or machine-learning). LUIS does use natural language processing (or machine-learning) to select the correct top-scoring intent. Additionally, an utterance can be a mix of more than one entity or even more than one type of entity. Each utterance is processed for all the entities in the app, including natural language processing (or machine-learned) entities.

## <a name="what-has-this-luis-app-accomplished"></a>What has this LUIS app accomplished?
This app, with a list entity, extracted the correct employee. 

Your chatbot now has enough information to determine the primary action, `MoveEmployee`, and which employee to move. 

## <a name="where-is-this-luis-data-used"></a>Where is this LUIS data used? 
LUIS is done with this request. The calling application, such as a chatbot, can take the topScoringIntent result and the data from the entity to take the next step. LUIS doesn't do that programmatic work for the bot or calling application. LUIS only determines what the user's intention is.
