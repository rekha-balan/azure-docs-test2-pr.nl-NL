title: Use prebuilt domains to build apps quicker in LUIS apps
titleSuffix: Azure Cognitive Services
description: Language Understanding (LUIS) provides prebuilt domains, which are prebuilt sets of intents and entities that work together for domains or common categories of client applications. The prebuilt domains have been pre-trained and are ready for you to add to your LUIS app.
