# <a name="tutorial-5-add-hierarchical-entity"></a>Tutorial: 5. Add hierarchical entity
In this tutorial, create an app that demonstrates how to find related pieces of data based on context. 

<!-- green checkmark -->
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Understand hierarchical entities and contextually learned children 
> * Use LUIS app in Human Resources (HR) domain 
> * Add location hierarchical entity with origin and destination children
> * Train, and publish app
> * Query endpoint of app to see LUIS JSON response including hierarchical children 

[!INCLUDE [LUIS Free account](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-free-key-short.md)]

## <a name="before-you-begin"></a>Before you begin
If you don't have the Human Resources app from the [list entities](luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity.md) tutorial, [import](luis-how-to-start-new-app.md#import-new-app) the JSON into a new app in the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) website. The app to import is found in the [LUIS-Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/blob/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/custom-domain-list-HumanResources.json) Github repository.

If you want to keep the original Human Resources app, clone the version on the [Settings](luis-how-to-manage-versions.md#clone-a-version) page, and name it `hier`. Cloning is a great way to play with various LUIS features without affecting the original version. 

## <a name="purpose-of-the-app-with-this-entity"></a>Purpose of the app with this entity
This app determines where an employee is to be moved from the origin location (building and office) to the destination location (building and office). It uses the hierarchical entity to determine the locations within the utterance. 

The hierarchical entity is a good fit for this type of data because the two pieces of data:

* Are related to each other in the context of the utterance.
* Use specific word choice to indicate each location. Examples of these words include: from/to, leaving/headed to, away from/toward.
* Both locations are frequently in the same utterance. 

The purpose of the **hierarchical** entity is to find related data within the utterance based on context. Consider the following utterance:

```JSON
mv Jill Jones from a-2349 to b-1298
```
The utterance has two locations specified, `a-2349` and `b-1298`. Assume that the letter corresponds to a building name and the number indicates the office within that building. It makes sense that they are both grouped as children of a hierarchical entity, `Locations` because both pieces of data need to be extracted from the utterance and they are related to each other. 
 
If only one child (origin or destination) of a hierarchical entity is present, it is still extracted. All children do not need to be found for just one, or some, to be extracted. 

## <a name="remove-prebuilt-number-entity-from-app"></a>Remove prebuilt number entity from app
In order to see the entire utterance and mark the hierarchical children, temporarily remove the prebuilt number entity.

1. Make sure your Human Resources app is in the **Build** section of LUIS. You can change to this section by selecting **Build** on the top, right menu bar. 

2. Select **Entities** from the left menu.

3. Select the ellipsis (***...***) button to the right of the number entity in the list. Select **Delete**.

## <a name="add-utterances-to-moveemployee-intent"></a>Add utterances to MoveEmployee intent

1. Select **Intents** from the left menu.

2. Select **MoveEmployee** from the list of intents.

    [ ![Screenshot of LUIS app with MoveEmployee intent highlighted in left menu](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-intents-list-moveemployee.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-intents-list-moveemployee.png#lightbox)

3. Add the following example utterances:

    |Example utterances|
    |--|
    |Move John W. Smith **to** a-2345|
    |Direct Jill Jones **to** b-3499|
    |Organize the move of x23456 **from** hh-2345 **to** e-0234|
    |Begin paperwork to set x12345 **leaving** a-3459 **headed to** f-34567|
    |Displace 425-555-0000 **away from** g-2323 **toward** hh-2345|

    [ ![Screenshot of LUIS with new utterances in MoveEmployee intent](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-enter-utterances.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-enter-utterances.png#lightbox)

    In the [list entity](luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity.md) tutorial, an employee could be designated by name, email address, phone extension, mobile phone number, or U.S. federal social security number. These employee numbers are used in the utterances. The previous example utterances include different ways to note the origin and destination locations, marked in bold. A couple of the utterances only have destinations on purpose. This helps LUIS understand how those locations are placed in the utterance when the origin is not specified.     

## <a name="create-a-location-entity"></a>Create a location entity
LUIS needs to understand what a location is by labeling the origin and destination in the utterances. If you need to see the utterance in the token (raw) view, select the toggle in the bar above the utterances labeled **Entities View**. After you toggle the switch, the control is labeled **Tokens View**.

1. In the utterance, `Displace 425-555-0000 away from g-2323 toward hh-2345`, select the word `g-2323`. A drop-down menu appears with a text box at the top. Enter the entity name `Locations` in the text box then select **Create new entity** in the drop-down menu. 

    [![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-create-new-entity-1.png "Screenshot of creating new entity on intent page")](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-create-new-entity-1.png#lightbox)

2. In the pop-up window, select the **Hierarchical** entity type with `Origin` and `Destination` as the child entities. Select **Done**.

    ![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-create-new-entity-2.png "Screenshot of entity creation pop-up dialog for new Location entity")

3. The label for `g-2323` is marked as `Locations` because LUIS doesn't know if the term was the origin or destination, or neither. Select `g-2323`, then select **Locations**, then follow the menu to the right and select `Origin`.

    [![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-label-entity.png "Screenshot of entity labeling pop-up dialog to change locations entity child")](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-label-entity.png#lightbox)

5. Label the other locations in all the other utterances by selecting the building and office in the utterance, then selecting Locations, then following the menu to the right to select `Origin` or `Destination`. When all locations are labeled, the utterances in **Tokens View** begin to look like a pattern. 

    [![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-entities-labeled.png "Screenshot of Locations entity labeled in utterances")](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-entities-labeled.png#lightbox)

## <a name="add-prebuilt-number-entity-to-app"></a>Add prebuilt number entity to app
Add the prebuilt number entity back to the application.

1. Select **Entities** from the left navigation menu.

2. Select **Manage prebuilt entities** button.

    [ ![Screenshot of Entities list with Manage prebuilt entities highlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-manage-prebuilt-button.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/hr-manage-prebuilt-button.png#lightbox)

3. Select **number** from the list of prebuilt entities then select **Done**.

1. [!INCLUDE [LUIS How to get endpoint first step](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-get-endpoint.md)]


2. Go to the end of the URL in the address bar and enter `Please relocation jill-jones@mycompany.com from x-2345 to g-23456`. The last querystring parameter is `q`, the utterance **query**. This utterance is not the same as any of the labeled utterances so it is a good test and should return the `MoveEmployee` intent with the hierarchical entity extracted.

## <a name="could-you-have-used-a-regular-expression-for-each-location"></a>Could you have used a regular expression for each location?
Yes, create the regular expression with origin and destination roles and use it in a pattern.

The locations in this example, such as `a-1234`, follow a specific format of one or two letters with a dash then a series of 4 or 5 numerals. This data can be described as a regular expression entity with a role for each location. Roles are available for patterns. You can create patterns based on these utterances, then create a regular expression for the location format and add it to the patterns. <!-- Go to this tutorial to see how that is done -->

## <a name="patterns-with-roles"></a>Patterns with roles

[!INCLUDE [LUIS Compare hierarchical entities to patterns with roles](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-hier-roles.md)]

## <a name="what-has-this-luis-app-accomplished"></a>What has this LUIS app accomplished?
This app, with just a few intents and a hierarchical entity, identified a natural language query intention and returned the extracted data. 

Your chatbot now has enough information to determine the primary action, `MoveEmployee`, and the location information found in the utterance. 

## <a name="where-is-this-luis-data-used"></a>Where is this LUIS data used? 
LUIS is done with this request. The calling application, such as a chatbot, can take the topScoringIntent result and the data from the entity to take the next step. LUIS doesn't do that programmatic work for the bot or calling application. LUIS only determines what the user's intention is.
