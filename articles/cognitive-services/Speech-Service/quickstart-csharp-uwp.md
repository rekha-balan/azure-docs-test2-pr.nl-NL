# <a name="quickstart-recognize-speech-in-a-uwp-app-using-the-speech-sdk"></a>Quickstart: Recognize speech in a UWP app using the Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [Selector](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-selector.md)]

In this article, you create a C# Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application using the Cognitive Services [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) to transcribe speech to text in real time from your device's microphone. The application is built with the [Speech SDK NuGet Package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (any edition).

> [!NOTE]
> The Universal Windows Platform lets you develop apps that run on any device that supports Windows 10, including PCs, Xbox, Surface Hub, and other devices. Apps using the Speech SDK do not yet pass the Windows App Certification Kit (WACK). It is possible to sideload your app, but it may not currently be submitted to the Windows Store.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

You need a Speech service subscription key to complete this Quickstart. You can get one for free. See [Try the speech service for free](get-started.md) for details.

## <a name="create-visual-studio-project"></a>Create Visual Studio project

1. Start Visual Studio 2017.

1. Make sure the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload is available. Choose **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features** from the Visual Studio menu bar to open the Visual Studio installer. If this workload is already enabled, close the dialog. 

    ![Enable Universal Windows Platform development](media/sdk/vs-enable-uwp-workload.png)

    Otherwise, mark the checkbox next to **.NET cross-platform development,** then click the **Modify** button at the lower right corner of the dialog. Installation of the new feature takes a moment.

1. Create a blank Visual C# Universal Windows app. First, choose **File** \> **New** \> **Project** from the menu. In the **New Project** dialog, expand **Installed** \> **Visual C#** \> **Windows Universal** in the left pane, then select **Blank App (Universal Windows)**. For the project name, enter *helloworld*.

    ![](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-01-new-blank-app.png)

1. The Speed SDK requires that your application be built for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update or later. In the **New Universal Windows Platform Project** window that pops up, choose **Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (10.0; Build 16299)** as **Minimum version**, and this or any later version as **Target version**, then click **OK**.

    ![](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-02-new-uwp-project.png)

1. If you're running 64-bit Windows, you may switch your build platform to `x64` using the drop-down menu in the Visual Studio toolbar. (64-bit Windows can run 32-bit applications, so you may leave it set to `x86` if you prefer.)

   ![Switch the build platform to x64](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-03-switch-to-x64.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Speech SDK supports Intel-compatible processors only. ARM is currently not supported.

1. Install and reference the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget). In the Solution Explorer, right-click the solution and select **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.

    ![Right-click Manage NuGet Packages for Solution](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-04-manage-nuget-packages.png)

1. In the upper-right corner, in the **Package Source** field, select **Nuget.org**. Search for the `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` package and install it into the **helloworld** project.

    ![Install Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech NuGet Package](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-05-nuget-install-0.5.0.png "Install Nuget package")

1. Accept the displayed license to begin installation of the NuGet package.

    ![Accept the license](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-06-nuget-license.png "Accept the license")

    After the package is installed, a confirmation appears in the Package Manager console.

1. Since the application uses the microphone for speech input, add the **Microphone** capability to the project.

   In Solution Explorer, double-click **Package.appxmanifest** to edit your application manifest.
   Then switch to the **Capabilities** tab, mark the checkbox for the **Microphone** capability, and save your changes.

## <a name="add-sample-code"></a>Add sample code

1. The application's user interface is defined using XAML. Open `MainPage.xaml` in the Solution Explorer. In the designer's XAML view, insert the following XAML snippet into the Grid tag (between `<Grid>` and `</Grid>`).

   [!code-xml[UI elements](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp-uwp/helloworld/MainPage.xaml#StackPanel)]

1. Open the code-behind source file `MainPage.xaml.cs` (find it grouped under `MainPage.xaml`). Replace all the code in it with the following.

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp-uwp/helloworld/MainPage.xaml.cs#code)]

1. In the `SpeechRecognitionFromMicrophone_ButtonClicked` handler in this file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. In the `SpeechRecognitionFromMicrophone_ButtonClicked` handler, replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Save all changes to the project.

## <a name="build-and-run-the-app"></a>Build and run the app

1. Build the application. From the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution**. The code should compile without errors now.

    ![Successful build](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-08-build.png "Successful build")

1. Start the application. From the menu bar, select **Debug** > **Start Debugging**, or press **F5**.

    ![Start the app into debugging](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-09-start-debugging.png "Start the app into debugging")

1. A GUI window pops up. First click the **Enable Microphone** button and acknowledge the permission request that pops up.

    ![Start the app into debugging](media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-10-access-prompt.png "Start the app into debugging")

1. Click the **Speech recognition with microphone input** and speak an English phrase or sentence into your device's microphone. Your speech is transmitted to the Speech service and transcribed to text, which appears in the window.
