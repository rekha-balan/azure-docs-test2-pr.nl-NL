# <a name="quickstart-recognize-speech-in-c-on-windows-using-the-speech-sdk"></a>Quickstart: Recognize speech in C++ on Windows using the Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [Selector](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-selector.md)]

In this article, you create a C++ console application for Windows using the Cognitive Services [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) to transcribe speech to text in real time from your PC's microphone. The application is built with the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (any edition).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

You need a Speech service subscription key to complete this Quickstart. You can get one for free. See [Try the speech service for free](get-started.md) for details.

## <a name="create-visual-studio-project"></a>Create Visual Studio project

1. Start Visual Studio 2017.

1. Make sure the **Desktop development with C++** workload is available. Choose **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features** from the Visual Studio menu bar to open the Visual Studio installer. If this workload is already enabled, skip to the next step. 

    ![Enable Desktop development with C++ workload](media/sdk/vs-enable-cpp-workload.png)

    Otherwise, mark the checkbox next to **Desktop development with C++,** 

1. Make sure the **NuGet package manager** component is available. Switch to the Individual Components tab of the Visual Studio installer dialog and mark the **NuGet package manager** checkbox if it is not already enabled.

      ![Enable NuGet package manager in Visual Studio ](media/sdk/vs-enable-nuget-package-manager.png)

1. If you needed to enable either the C++ workload or NuGet, click the **Modify** button at the lower right corner of the dialog. Installation of the new features takes a moment. If both features were already enabled, close the dialog instead.

1. Create a new Visual C++ Windows Desktop Windows console Application. First, choose **File** \> **New** \> **Project** from the menu. In the **New Project** dialog, expand **Installed** \> **Visual C++** \> **Windows Desktop** in the left pane, then select **Windows Console Application**. For the project name, enter *helloworld*.

1. If you're running 64-bit Windows, you may switch your build platform to `x64` using the drop-down menu in the Visual Studio toolbar. (64-bit versions of Windows can run 32-bit applications, so this is not a requirement.)

    ![Switch the build platform to x64](media/sdk/qs-cpp-windows-02-switch-to-x64.png)

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution and choose **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.

    ![Right-click Manage NuGet Packages for Solution](media/sdk/qs-cpp-windows-03-manage-nuget-packages.png)

1. In the upper-right corner, in the **Package Source** field, select **Nuget.org**. Search for the `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` package and install it into the **helloworld** project.

    ![Install Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech NuGet Package](media/sdk/qs-cpp-windows-04-nuget-install-0.5.0.png)

1. Accept the displayed license to begin installation of the NuGet package.

    ![Accept the license](media/sdk/qs-cpp-windows-05-nuget-license.png)

After the package is installed, a confirmation appears in the Package Manager console.

## <a name="add-sample-code"></a>Add sample code

1. Open the source file *helloworld.cpp*. Replace all the code in it with the following.

   [!code-cpp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/cpp-windows/helloworld/helloworld.cpp#code)]

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Also replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Save changes to the project.

## <a name="build-and-run-the-app"></a>Build and run the app

1. Build the application. From the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**. The code should compile without errors.

   ![Successful build](media/sdk/qs-cpp-windows-06-build.png)

1. Start the application. From the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging**, or press **F5**.

   ![Launch the app into debugging](media/sdk/qs-cpp-windows-07-start-debugging.png)

1. A console window appears, prompting you to say something. Speak an English phrase or sentence. Your speech is transmitted to the Speech service and transcribed to text, which appears in the same window.
