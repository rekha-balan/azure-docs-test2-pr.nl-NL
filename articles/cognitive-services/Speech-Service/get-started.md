# <a name="try-the-speech-service-for-free"></a>Try the Speech service for free

Getting started with the Speech service is easy and affordable. A 30-day free trial lets you discover what the service can do and decide whether it's right for your application's needs.

If you need more time, sign up for a Microsoft Azure accountâ€”it comes with $200 in service credit that you can apply toward a paid Speech service subscription for up to 30 days.

Finally, the Speech service offers a free, low-volume tier that's suitable for developing applications. You can keep this free subscription even after your service credit expires.

To sign up for a 30-day free trial:
