# <a name="quickstart-recognize-speech-in-c-under-net-framework-on-windows-using-the-speech-sdk"></a>Quickstart: Recognize speech in C# under .NET Framework on Windows using the Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [Selector](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-selector.md)]

In this article, you create a C# console application for .NET Framework on Windows using the [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) to transcribe speech to text in real time from your PC's microphone.
The application is built with the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (any edition).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

You need a Speech service subscription key to complete this Quickstart. You can get one for free. See [Try the speech service for free](get-started.md) for details.

## <a name="create-visual-studio-project"></a>Create Visual Studio project

1. Start Visual Studio 2017.
 
1. Make sure the **.NET desktop environment** workload is available. Choose **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features** from the Visual Studio menu bar to open the Visual Studio installer. If this workload is already enabled, close the dialog. 

    Otherwise, mark the checkbox next to **.NET desktop development,** then click the **Modify** button at the lower right corner of the dialog. Installation of the new feature will take a moment.

    ![Enable .NET desktop development](media/sdk/vs-enable-net-desktop-workload.png)

1. Create a new Visual C# Console App. In the **New Project** dialog box, from the left pane, expand **Installed** \> **Visual C#** \> **Windows Desktop** and then choose **Console App (.NET Framework)**. For the project name, enter *helloworld*.

    ![Create Visual C# Console App (.NET Framework)](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-01-new-console-app.png "Create Visual C# Console App (.NET Framework)")

1. Install and reference the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget). In the Solution Explorer, right-click the solution and select **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.

    ![Right-click Manage NuGet Packages for Solution](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-02-manage-nuget-packages.png "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution")

1. In the upper-right corner, in the **Package Source** field, select **Nuget.org**. Search for the `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` package and install it into the **helloworld** project.

    ![Install Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech NuGet Package](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-03-nuget-install-0.5.0.png "Install Nuget package")

1. Accept the displayed license to begin installation of the NuGet package.

    ![Accept the license](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-04-nuget-license.png "Accept the license")

    After the package is installed, a confirmation appears in the Package Manager console.

1. Create a platform configuration matching your PC architecture via the Configuration Manager. Select **Build** > **Configuration Manager**.

    ![Launch the configuration manager](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-05-cfg-manager-click.png "Launch the configuration manager")

1. In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, add a new platform. From the **Active solution platform** drop-down list, select **New**.

    ![Add a new platform under the configuration manager window](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-06-cfg-manager-new.png "Add a new platform under the configuration manager window")

1. If you are running 64-bit Windows, create a new platform configuration named `x64`. If you are running 32-bit Windows, create a new platform configuration named `x86`.

    ![On 64-bit Windows, add a new platform named "x64"](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-07-cfg-manager-add-x64.png "Add x64 platform")


## <a name="add-sample-code"></a>Add sample code

1. Open `Program.cs` and replace all the code in it with the following.

    [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp-dotnet-windows/helloworld/Program.cs#code)]

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech service subscription key.

1. Also replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Save changes to the project.

## <a name="build-and-run-the-app"></a>Build and run the app

1. Build the application. From the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution**. The code should compile without errors now.

    ![Successful build](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-08-build.png "Successful build")

1. Start the application. From the menu bar, select **Debug** > **Start Debugging**, or press **F5**.

    ![Start the app into debugging](media/sdk/qs-csharp-dotnet-windows-09-start-debugging.png "Start the app into debugging")

1. A console window appears, prompting you to say something. Speak an English phrase or sentence. Your speech is transmitted to the Speech service and transcribed to text, which appears in the same window.
