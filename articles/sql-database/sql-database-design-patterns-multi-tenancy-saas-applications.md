title: Design patterns for multitenant SaaS applications and Azure SQL Database | Microsoft Docs
description: This article discusses the requirements and common data architecture patterns of multitenant database applications running in a cloud environment need to consider and the various tradeoffs associated with these patterns. It also explains how Azure SQL Database, with its elastic pools and elastic tools, help address these requirements in a no-compromise fashion.
