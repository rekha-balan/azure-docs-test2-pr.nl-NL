When you're running an Azure Service Fabric cluster, it's a good idea to collect the logs from all the nodes in a central location. Having the logs in a central location helps you analyze and troubleshoot issues in your cluster, or issues in the applications and services running in that cluster.

One way to upload and collect logs is to use the Azure Diagnostics extension, which uploads logs to Azure Storage, Azure Application Insights, or Azure Event Hubs. The logs are not that useful directly in storage or in Event Hubs. But you can use an external process to read the events from storage and place them in a product such as [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-service-fabric.md) or another log-parsing solution. [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/) comes with a comprehensive log search and analytics service built-in.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
You use these tools to perform some of the operations in this document:

* [Azure Diagnostics](../cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics.md) (related to Azure Cloud Services but has good information and examples)
* [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md)
* [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs)
* [Azure Resource Manager client](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient)
* [Azure Resource Manager template](../virtual-machines/windows/extensions-diagnostics-template.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json)

## <a name="log-sources-that-you-might-want-to-collect"></a>Log sources that you might want to collect
* **Service Fabric logs**: Emitted from the platform to standard Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and EventSource channels. Logs can be one of several types:
  * Operational events: Logs for operations that the Service Fabric platform performs. Examples include creation of applications and services, node state changes, and upgrade information.
  * [Reliable Actors programming model events](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md)
  * [Reliable Services programming model events](service-fabric-reliable-services-diagnostics.md)
* **Application events**: Events emitted from your service's code and written out by using the EventSource helper class provided in the Visual Studio templates. For more information on how to write logs from your application, see [Monitor and diagnose services in a local machine development setup](service-fabric-diagnostics-how-to-monitor-and-diagnose-services-locally.md).

## <a name="deploy-the-diagnostics-extension"></a>Deploy the Diagnostics extension
The first step in collecting logs is to deploy the Diagnostics extension on each of the VMs in the Service Fabric cluster. The Diagnostics extension collects logs on each VM and uploads them to the storage account that you specify. The steps vary a little based on whether you use the Azure portal or Azure Resource Manager. The steps also vary based on whether the deployment is part of cluster creation or is for a cluster that already exists. Let's look at the steps for each scenario.

### <a name="deploy-the-diagnostics-extension-as-part-of-cluster-creation-through-the-portal"></a>Deploy the Diagnostics extension as part of cluster creation through the portal
To deploy the Diagnostics extension to the VMs in the cluster as part of cluster creation, you use the Diagnostics settings panel shown in the following image. To enable Reliable Actors or Reliable Services event collection, ensure that Diagnostics is set to **On** (the default setting). After you create the cluster, you can't change these settings by using the portal.

![Azure Diagnostics settings in the portal for cluster creation](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/service-fabric/media/service-fabric-diagnostics-how-to-setup-wad/portal-cluster-creation-diagnostics-setting.png)

The Azure support team *requires* support logs to help resolve any support requests that you create. These logs are collected in real time and are stored in one of the storage accounts created in the resource group. The Diagnostics settings configure application-level events. These events include [Reliable Actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md) events, [Reliable Services](service-fabric-reliable-services-diagnostics.md) events, and some system-level Service Fabric events to be stored in Azure Storage.

Products such as [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) or your own process can get the events from the storage account. There is currently no way to filter or groom the events that are sent to the table. If you don't implement a process to remove events from the table, the table will continue to grow.

When you're creating a cluster by using the portal, we highly recommend that you download the template **before you click OK** to create the cluster. For details, refer to [Set up a Service Fabric cluster by using an Azure Resource Manager template](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-arm.md). You'll need the template to make changes later, because you can't make some changes by using the portal.

You can export templates from the portal by using the following steps. However, these templates can be more difficult to use because they might have null values that are missing required information.

1. Open your resource group.
2. Select **Settings** to display the settings panel.
3. Select **Deployments** to display the deployment history panel.
4. Select a deployment to display the details of the deployment.
5. Select **Export Template** to display the template panel.
6. Select **Save to file** to export a .zip file that contains the template, parameter, and PowerShell files.

After you export the files, you need to make a modification. Edit the parameters.json file and remove the **adminPassword** element. This will cause a prompt for the password when the deployment script is run. When you're running the deployment script, you might have to fix null parameter values.

To use the downloaded template to update a configuration:

1. Extract the contents to a folder on your local computer.
2. Modify the contents to reflect the new configuration.
3. Start PowerShell and change to the folder where you extracted the content.
4. Run **deploy.ps1** and fill in the subscription ID, the resource group name (use the same name to update the configuration), and a unique deployment name.

### <a name="deploy-the-diagnostics-extension-as-part-of-cluster-creation-by-using-azure-resource-manager"></a>Deploy the Diagnostics extension as part of cluster creation by using Azure Resource Manager
To create a cluster by using Resource Manager, you need to add the Diagnostics configuration JSON to the full cluster Resource Manager template before you create the cluster. We provide a sample five-VM cluster Resource Manager template with Diagnostics configuration added to it as part of our Resource Manager template samples. You can see it at this location in the Azure Samples gallery: [Five-node cluster with Diagnostics Resource Manager template sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/service-fabric-secure-cluster-5-node-1-nodetype-wad).

To see the Diagnostics setting in the Resource Manager template, open the azuredeploy.json file and search for **IaaSDiagnostics**. To create a cluster by using this template, select the **Deploy to Azure** button available at the previous link.

Alternatively, you can download the Resource Manager sample, make changes to it, and create a cluster with the modified template by using the `New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment` command in an Azure PowerShell window. See the following code for the parameters that you pass in to the command. For detailed information on how to deploy a resource group by using PowerShell, see the article [Deploy a resource group with the Azure Resource Manager template](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md).

```powershell

New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $deploymentName -TemplateFile $pathToARMConfigJsonFile -TemplateParameterFile $pathToParameterFile â€“Verbose
```

### <a name="deploy-the-diagnostics-extension-to-an-existing-cluster"></a>Deploy the Diagnostics extension to an existing cluster
If you have an existing cluster that doesn't have Diagnostics deployed, or if you want to modify an existing configuration, you can add or update it. Modify the Resource Manager template that's used to create the existing cluster or download the template from the portal as described earlier. Modify the template.json file by performing the following tasks.

Add a new storage resource to the template by adding to the resources section.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
  "name": "[parameters('applicationDiagnosticsStorageAccountName')]",
  "location": "[parameters('computeLocation')]",
  "properties": {
    "accountType": "[parameters('applicationDiagnosticsStorageAccountType')]"
  },
  "tags": {
    "resourceType": "Service Fabric",
    "clusterName": "[parameters('clusterName')]"
  }
},
```

 Next, add to the parameters section just after the storage account definitions, between `supportLogStorageAccountName` and `vmNodeType0Name`. Replace the placeholder text *storage account name goes here* with the name of the storage account.

```json
    "applicationDiagnosticsStorageAccountType": {
      "type": "string",
      "allowedValues": [
        "Standard_LRS",
        "Standard_GRS"
      ],
      "defaultValue": "Standard_LRS",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Replication option for the application diagnostics storage account"
      }
    },
    "applicationDiagnosticsStorageAccountName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "storage account name goes here",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Name for the storage account that contains application diagnostics data from the cluster"
      }
    },
```
Then, update the `VirtualMachineProfile` section of the template.json file by adding the following code within the extensions array. Be sure to add a comma at the beginning or the end, depending on where it's inserted.

```json
{
    "name": "[concat(parameters('vmNodeType0Name'),'_Microsoft.Insights.VMDiagnosticsSettings')]",
    "properties": {
        "type": "IaaSDiagnostics",
        "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
        "protectedSettings": {
        "storageAccountName": "[parameters('applicationDiagnosticsStorageAccountName')]",
        "storageAccountKey": "[listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('applicationDiagnosticsStorageAccountName')),'2015-05-01-preview').key1]",
        "storageAccountEndPoint": "https://core.windows.net/"
        },
        "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics",
        "settings": {
        "WadCfg": {
            "DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration": {
            "overallQuotaInMB": "50000",
            "EtwProviders": {
                "EtwEventSourceProviderConfiguration": [
                {
                    "provider": "Microsoft-ServiceFabric-Actors",
                    "scheduledTransferKeywordFilter": "1",
                    "scheduledTransferPeriod": "PT5M",
                    "DefaultEvents": {
                    "eventDestination": "ServiceFabricReliableActorEventTable"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "provider": "Microsoft-ServiceFabric-Services",
                    "scheduledTransferPeriod": "PT5M",
                    "DefaultEvents": {
                    "eventDestination": "ServiceFabricReliableServiceEventTable"
                    }
                }
                ],
                "EtwManifestProviderConfiguration": [
                {
                    "provider": "cbd93bc2-71e5-4566-b3a7-595d8eeca6e8",
                    "scheduledTransferLogLevelFilter": "Information",
                    "scheduledTransferKeywordFilter": "4611686018427387904",
                    "scheduledTransferPeriod": "PT5M",
                    "DefaultEvents": {
                    "eventDestination": "ServiceFabricSystemEventTable"
                    }
                }
                ]
            }
            }
        },
        "StorageAccount": "[parameters('applicationDiagnosticsStorageAccountName')]"
        },
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.5"
    }
}
```

After you modify the template.json file as described, republish the Resource Manager template. If the template was exported, running the deploy.ps1 file republishes the template. After you deploy, ensure that **ProvisioningState** is **Succeeded**.

## <a name="update-diagnostics-to-collect-health-and-load-events"></a>Update diagnostics to collect health and load events

Starting with the 5.4 release of Service Fabric, health and load metric events are available for collection. These events reflect events generated by the system or your code by using the health or load reporting APIs such as [ReportPartitionHealth](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/system.fabric.iservicepartition.reportpartitionhealth.aspx) or [ReportLoad](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/system.fabric.iservicepartition.reportload.aspx). This allows for aggregating and viewing system health over time and for alerting based on health or load events. To view these events in Visual Studio's Diagnostic Event Viewer add "Microsoft-ServiceFabric:4:0x4000000000000008" to the list of ETW providers.

To collect the events, modify the resource manager template to include

```json
  "EtwManifestProviderConfiguration": [
    {
      "provider": "cbd93bc2-71e5-4566-b3a7-595d8eeca6e8",
      "scheduledTransferLogLevelFilter": "Information",
      "scheduledTransferKeywordFilter": "4611686018427387912",
      "scheduledTransferPeriod": "PT5M",
      "DefaultEvents": {
        "eventDestination": "ServiceFabricSystemEventTable"
      }
    }
```

## <a name="update-diagnostics-to-collect-and-upload-logs-from-new-eventsource-channels"></a>Update Diagnostics to collect and upload logs from new EventSource channels
To update Diagnostics to collect logs from new EventSource channels that represent a new application that you're about to deploy, perform the same steps as in the [previous section](#deploywadarm) for setup of Diagnostics for an existing cluster.

Update the `EtwEventSourceProviderConfiguration` section in the template.json file to add entries for the new EventSource channels before you apply the configuration update by using the `New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment` PowerShell command. The name of the event source is defined as part of your code in the Visual Studio-generated ServiceEventSource.cs file.

For example, if your event source is named My-Eventsource, add the following code to place the events from My-Eventsource into a table named MyDestinationTableName.

```json
        {
            "provider": "My-Eventsource",
            "scheduledTransferPeriod": "PT5M",
            "DefaultEvents": {
            "eventDestination": "MyDestinationTableName"
            }
        }
```

To collect performance counters or event logs, modify the Resource Manager template by using the examples provided in [Create a Windows virtual machine with monitoring and diagnostics by using an Azure Resource Manager template](../virtual-machines/windows/extensions-diagnostics-template.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json). Then, republish the Resource Manager template.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
To understand in more detail what events you should look for while troubleshooting issues, see the diagnostic events emitted for [Reliable Actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md) and [Reliable Services](service-fabric-reliable-services-diagnostics.md).
