# <a name="service-fabric-cluster-capacity-planning-considerations"></a>Service Fabric cluster capacity planning considerations
For any production deployment, capacity planning is an important step. Here are some of the items that you have to consider as a part of that process.

* The number of node types your cluster needs to start out with
* The properties of each of node type (size, primary, internet facing, number of VMs, etc.)
* The reliability and durability characteristics of the cluster

Let us briefly review each of these items.

## <a name="the-number-of-node-types-your-cluster-needs-to-start-out-with"></a>The number of node types your cluster needs to start out with
First, you need to figure out what the cluster you are creating is going to be used for and what kinds of applications you are planning to deploy into this cluster. If you are not clear on the purpose of the cluster, you are most likely not yet ready to enter the capacity planning process.

Establish the number of node types your cluster needs to start out with.  Each node type is mapped to a Virtual Machine Scale Set. Each node type can then be scaled up or down independently, have different sets of ports open, and can have different capacity metrics. So the decision of the number of node types essentially comes down to the following considerations:

* Does your application have multiple services, and do any of them need to be public or internet facing? Typical applications contain a front-end gateway service that receives input from a client, and one or more back-end services that communicate with the front-end services. So in this case, you end up having at least two node types.
* Do your services (that make up your application) have different infrastructure needs such as greater RAM or higher CPU cycles? For example, let us assume that the application that you want to deploy contains a front-end service and a back-end service. The front-end service can run on smaller VMs (VM sizes like D2) that have ports open to the internet.  The back-end service, however, is computation intensive and needs to run on larger VMs (with VM sizes like D4, D6, D15) that are not internet facing.
  
  In this example, although you can decide to put all the services on one node type, we recommended that you place them in a cluster with two node types.  This allows for each node type to have distinct properties such as internet connectivity or VM size. The number of VMs can be scaled independently, as well.  
* Since you cannot predict the future, go with facts you know of and decide on the number of node types that your applications need to start with. You can always add or remove node types later. A Service Fabric cluster must have at least one node type.

## <a name="the-properties-of-each-node-type"></a>The properties of each node type
The **node type** can be seen as equivalent to roles in Cloud Services. Node types define the VM sizes, the number of VMs, and their properties. Every node type that is defined in a Service Fabric cluster is set up as a separate Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS). VMSS is an Azure compute resource you can use to deploy and manage a collection of virtual machines as a set. Being defined as distinct VMSS, each node type can then be scaled up or down independently, have different sets of ports open, and can have different capacity metrics.

Read [this document](service-fabric-cluster-nodetypes.md) for more details on the relationship of Nodetypes to VMSS, how to RDP into one of the instances, open new ports etc.

Your cluster can have more than one node type, but the primary node type (the first one that you define on the portal) must have at least five VMs for clusters used for production workloads (or at least three VMs for test clusters). If you are creating the cluster using a Resource Manager template, then you will find a **is Primary** attribute under the node type definition. The primary node type is the node type where Service Fabric system services are placed.  

### <a name="primary-node-type"></a>Primary node type
For a cluster with multiple node types, you will need to choose one of them to be primary. Here are the characteristics of a primary node type:

* The **minimum size of VMs** for the primary node type is determined by the **durability tier** you choose. The default for the durability tier is Bronze. Scroll down for details on what the durability tier is and the values it can take.  
* The **minimum number of VMs** for the primary node type is determined by the **reliability tier** you choose. The default for the reliability tier is Silver. Scroll down for details on what the reliability tier is and the values it can take. 

 

* The Service Fabric system services (for example, the Cluster Manager service or Image Store service) are placed on the primary node type and so the reliability and durability of the cluster is determined by the reliability tier value and durability tier value you select for the primary node type.

### <a name="non-primary-node-type"></a>Non-primary node type
For a cluster with multiple node types, there is one primary node type and the rest of them are non-primary. Here are the characteristics of a non-primary node type:

* The minimum size of VMs for this node type is determined by the durability tier you choose. The default for the durability tier is Bronze. Scroll down for details on what the durability tier is and the values it can take.  
* The minimum number of VMs for this node type can be one. However you should choose this number based on the number of replicas of the application/services that you would like to run in this node type. The number of VMs in a node type can be increased after you have deployed the cluster.

## <a name="the-durability-characteristics-of-the-cluster"></a>The durability characteristics of the cluster
The durability tier is used to indicate to the system the privileges that your VMs have with the underlying Azure infrastructure. In the primary node type, this privilege allows Service Fabric to pause any VM level infrastructure request (such as a VM reboot, VM reimage, or VM migration) that impact the quorum requirements for the system services and your stateful services. In the non-primary node types, this privilege allows Service Fabric to pause any VM level infrastructure request like VM reboot, VM reimage, VM migration etc., that impact the quorum requirements for your stateful services running in it.

This privilege is expressed in the following values:

* Gold - The infrastructure Jobs can be paused for a duration of 2 hours per UD. Gold durability can be enabled only on full node VM skus like D15_V2, G5 etc.
* Silver - The infrastructure Jobs can be paused for a duration of 30 minutes per UD (This is currently not enabled for use. Once enabled this will be available on all standard VMs of single core and above).
* Bronze - No privileges. This is the default.

## <a name="the-reliability-characteristics-of-the-cluster"></a>The reliability characteristics of the cluster
The reliability tier is used to set the number of replicas of the system services that you want to run in this cluster on the primary node type. The more the number of replicas, the more reliable the system services are in your cluster.  

The reliability tier can take the following values.

* Platinum - Run the System services with a target replica set count of 9
* Gold - Run the System services with a target replica set count of 7
* Silver - Run the System services with a target replica set count of 5
* Bronze - Run the System services with a target replica set count of 3

> [!NOTE]
> The reliability tier you choose determines the minimum number of nodes your primary node type must have. The reliability tier has no bearing on the max size of the cluster. So you can have a 20 node cluster, that is running at Bronze reliability.
> 
> 

 You can choose to update the reliability of your cluster from one tier to another. Doing this will trigger the cluster upgrades needed to change the system services replica set count. Wait for the upgrade in progress to complete before making any other changes to the cluster, like adding nodes etc.  You can monitor the progress of the upgrade on Service Fabric Explorer or by running [Get-ServiceFabricClusterUpgrade](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt126012.aspx)


## <a name="primary-node-type---capacity-guidance"></a>Primary node type - Capacity Guidance

Here is the guidance for planning the primary node type capacity

1. **Number of VM instances:** To run any production workload in Azure, you must specify a reliability tier of Silver or higher, which then translates to a minimum Primary Node type size of 5.
2. **VM SKU:** Primary node type is where the system services run, so the VM SKU you choose for it, must take into account the overall peak load you plan to place into the cluster. Here is an analogy to illustrate what I mean here - Think of the primary node type as your "Lungs", it is what provides oxygen to your brain, and so if the brain does not get enough oxygen, your body suffers. 

The capacity needs of a cluster, is absolutely determined by workload you plan to run in the cluster, So we cannot provide you with a qualitative guidance for your specific workload, however here is the broad guidance to help you get started

For production workloads 


- The recommended VM SKU is Standard D3 or Standard D3_V2 or equivalent with a minimum of 14 GB of local SSD.
- The minimum supported use VM SKU is Standard D1 or Standard D1_V2 or equivalent with a minimum of 14 GB of local SSD. 
- Partial core VM SKUs like Standard A0 are not supported for production workloads.
- Standard A1 SKU is specifically not supported for production workloads for performance reasons.


## <a name="non-primary-node-type---capacity-guidance-for-stateful-workloads"></a>Non-Primary node type - Capacity Guidance for stateful workloads

Read the following for Workloads using Service fabric reliable collections or reliable Actors. Read more here [programming models here.](service-fabric-choose-framework.md)

1. **Number of VM instances:** For production workloads that are stateful, it is recommended that you run them with a minimum and target replica count of 5. This will mean that in steady state you will end up with a replica (from a replica set) in each fault domain and upgrade domain. The whole reliability tier concept for system services is actually just a way to specify this setting for system services.

So for production workloads, the minimum recommended non-Primary Node type size is 5, if you are running stateful workloads in it.

2. **VM SKU:** This is the node type where your application services are running, so the VM SKU you choose for it, must take into account the peak load you plan to place into each Node. The capacity needs of the nodetype, is absolutely determined by workload you plan to run in the cluster, So we cannot provide you with a qualitative guidance for your specific workload, however here is the broad guidance to help you get started

For production workloads 

- The recommended VM SKU is Standard D3 or Standard D3_V2 or equivalent with a minimum of 14 GB of local SSD.
- The minimum supported use VM SKU is Standard D1 or Standard D1_V2 or equivalent with a minimum of 14 GB of local SSD. 
- Partial core VM SKUs like Standard A0 are not supported for production workloads.
- Standard A1 SKU is specifically not supported for production workloads for performance reasons.


## <a name="non-primary-node-type---capacity-guidance-for-stateless-workloads"></a>Non-Primary node type - Capacity Guidance for stateless workloads

Read the following for stateless Workloads

**Number of VM instances:** For production workloads that are stateless,the minimum supported non-Primary Node type size is 2. This allows you to run you two stateless instances of your application and allowing your service to survive the loss of a VM instance. 

> [!NOTE]
> If your cluster is running on a service fabric version less than 5.6, due to a defect in the runtime (which is planned to be fixed in 5.6), scaling down a non-primary node type to less than 5, will result in cluster health turning unhealthy, till you call [Remove-ServiceFabricNodeState cmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/Remove-ServiceFabricNodeState) with the appropriate node name. Read [perform Service Fabric cluster in or out](service-fabric-cluster-scale-up-down.md) for more details
