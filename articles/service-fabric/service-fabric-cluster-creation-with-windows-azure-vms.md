# <a name="create-a-three-node-standalone-service-fabric-cluster-with-azure-virtual-machines-running-windows-server"></a>Create a three node standalone Service Fabric cluster with Azure virtual machines running Windows Server
This article describes how to create a cluster on Windows-based Azure virtual machines (VMs), using the standalone Service Fabric installer for Windows Server. The scenario is a special case of [Create and manage a cluster running on Windows Server](service-fabric-cluster-creation-for-windows-server.md) where the VMs are [Azure VMs running Windows Server](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-hero-tutorial.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json), however you are not creating [an Azure cloud-based Service Fabric cluster](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-portal.md). The distinction in following this pattern is that the standalone Service Fabric cluster created by the following steps is entirely managed by you, whereas the Azure cloud-based Service Fabric clusters are managed and upgraded by the Service Fabric resource provider.

## <a name="steps-to-create-the-standalone-cluster"></a>Steps to create the standalone cluster
1. Sign in to the Azure portal and create a new Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter or Windows Server 2016 Datacenter VM in a resource group. Read the article [Create a Windows VM in the Azure portal](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-hero-tutorial.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) for more details.
2. Add a couple more VMs to the same resource group. Ensure that each of the VMs has the same administrator user name and password when created. Once created you should see all three VMs in the same virtual network.
3. Connect to each of the VMs and turn off the Windows Firewall using the [Server Manager, Local Server dashboard](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj134147.aspx). This ensures that the network traffic can communicate between the machines. While connected to each machine, get the IP address by opening a command prompt and typing `ipconfig`. Alternatively you can see the IP address of each machine on the portal, by selecting the virtual network resource for the resource group and checking the network interfaces created for each of these machines.
4. Connect to one of the VMs and test that you can ping the other two VMs successfully.
5. Connect to one of the VMs and [download the standalone Service Fabric package for Windows Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=730690) into a new folder on the machine and extract the package.
6. Open the *ClusterConfig.Unsecure.MultiMachine.json* file in Notepad and edit each node with the three IP addresses of the machines. Change the cluster name at the top and save the file.  A partial example of the cluster manifest is shown below.
   
    ```
    {
        "name": "SampleCluster",
        "clusterConfigurationVersion": "1.0.0",
        "apiVersion": "01-2017",
        "nodes": [
        {
            "nodeName": "standalonenode0",
            "iPAddress": "10.1.0.4",
            "nodeTypeRef": "NodeType0",
            "faultDomain": "fd:/dc1/r0",
            "upgradeDomain": "UD0"
        },
        {
            "nodeName": "standalonenode1",
            "iPAddress": "10.1.0.5",
            "nodeTypeRef": "NodeType0",
            "faultDomain": "fd:/dc2/r0",
            "upgradeDomain": "UD1"
        },
        {
            "nodeName": "standalonenode2",
            "iPAddress": "10.1.0.6",
            "nodeTypeRef": "NodeType0",
            "faultDomain": "fd:/dc3/r0",
            "upgradeDomain": "UD2"
        }
        ],
    ```
7. If you intend this to be a secure cluster, decide the security measure you would like to use and follow the steps at the associated link: [X509 Certificate](service-fabric-windows-cluster-x509-security.md) or [Windows Security](service-fabric-windows-cluster-windows-security.md). If setting up the cluster using Windows Security, you will need to set up a domain controller to manage Active Directory. Note that using a domain controller machine as a Service Fabric node is not supported.
8. Open a [PowerShell ISE window](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/ise/introducing-the-windows-powershell-ise). Navigate to the folder where you extracted the downloaded standalone installer package and saved the cluster configuration file. Run the following PowerShell command to deploy the cluster:
   
    ```
    .\CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.MultiMachine.json
    ```

The script will remotely configure the Service Fabric cluster and should report progress as deployment rolls through.

9. After about a minute, you can check if the cluster is operational by connecting to the Service Fabric Explorer using one of the machine's IP addresses, for example by using `http://10.1.0.5:19080/Explorer/index.html`.
