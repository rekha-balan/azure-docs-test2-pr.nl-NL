# <a name="configure-security-policies-for-your-application"></a>Configure security policies for your application
By using Azure Service Fabric, you can help secure applications that are running in the cluster under different user accounts. Service Fabric also helps secure the resources that are used by applications at the time of deployment under the user accounts--for example, files, directories, and certificates. This makes running applications, even in a shared hosted environment, more secure from one another.

By default, Service Fabric applications run under the account that the Fabric.exe process runs under. Service Fabric also provides the capability to run applications under a local user account or local system account, which is specified within the application manifest. Supported local system account types are **LocalUser**, **NetworkService**, **LocalService**, and **LocalSystem**.

 When you're running Service Fabric on Windows Server in your datacenter by using the standalone installer, you can use Active Directory domain accounts.

You can define and create user groups so that one or more users can be added to each group to be managed together. This is useful when there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level.

## <a name="configure-the-policy-for-a-service-setup-entry-point"></a>Configure the policy for a service setup entry point
As described in the [application model](service-fabric-application-model.md), the setup entry point, **SetupEntryPoint**, is a privileged entry point that runs with the same credentials as Service Fabric (typically the *NetworkService* account) before any other entry point. The executable that is specified by **EntryPoint** is typically the long-running service host. So having a separate setup entry point avoids having to run the service host executable with high privileges for extended periods of time. The executable that **EntryPoint** specifies is run after **SetupEntryPoint** exits successfully. The resulting process is monitored and restarted, and begins again with **SetupEntryPoint** if it ever terminates or crashes.

The following is a simple service manifest example that shows the SetupEntryPoint and the main EntryPoint for the service.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ServiceManifest Name="MyServiceManifest" Version="SvcManifestVersion1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Description>An example service manifest</Description>
  <ServiceTypes>
    <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="MyServiceType" />
  </ServiceTypes>
  <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0.0">
    <SetupEntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
        <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
      </ExeHost>
    </SetupEntryPoint>
    <EntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MyServiceHost.exe</Program>
      </ExeHost>
    </EntryPoint>
  </CodePackage>
  <ConfigPackage Name="Config" Version="1.0.0" />
</ServiceManifest>
```

### <a name="configure-the-policy-by-using-a-local-account"></a>Configure the policy by using a local account
After you configure the service to have a setup entry point, you can change the security permissions that it runs under in the application manifest. The following example shows how to configure the service to run under user administrator account privileges.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
   <ServiceManifestImport>
      <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyServiceTypePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
      <ConfigOverrides />
      <Policies>
         <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupAdminUser" EntryPointType="Setup" />
      </Policies>
   </ServiceManifestImport>
   <Principals>
      <Users>
         <User Name="SetupAdminUser">
            <MemberOf>
               <SystemGroup Name="Administrators" />
            </MemberOf>
         </User>
      </Users>
   </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
```

First, create a **Principals** section with a user name, such as SetupAdminUser. This indicates that the user is a member of the Administrators system group.

Next, under the **ServiceManifestImport** section, configure a policy to apply this principal to **SetupEntryPoint**. This tells Service Fabric that when the **MySetup.bat** file is run, it should be `RunAs` with administrator privileges. Given that you have *not* applied a policy to the main entry point, the code in **MyServiceHost.exe** runs under the system **NetworkService** account. This is the default account that all service entry points are run as.

Let's now add the file MySetup.bat to the Visual Studio project to test the administrator privileges. In Visual Studio, right-click the service project and add a new file called MySetup.bat.

Next, ensure that the MySetup.bat file is included in the service package. By default, it is not. Select the file, right-click to get the context menu, and choose **Properties**. In the Properties dialog box, ensure that **Copy to Output Directory** is set to **Copy if newer**. See the following screenshot.

![Visual Studio CopyToOutput for SetupEntryPoint batch file][image1]

Now open the MySetup.bat file and add the following commands:

```
REM Set a system environment variable. This requires administrator privilege
setx -m TestVariable "MyValue"
echo System TestVariable set to > out.txt
echo %TestVariable% >> out.txt

REM To delete this system variable us
REM REG delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v TestVariable /f
```

Next, build and deploy the solution to a local development cluster. After the service has started, as shown in Service Fabric Explorer, you can see that the MySetup.bat file was successful in a two ways. Open a PowerShell command prompt and type:

```
PS C:\ [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine")
MyValue
```

Then, note the name of the node where the service was deployed and started in Service Fabric Explorer--for example, Node 2. Next, navigate to the application instance work folder to find the out.txt file that shows the value of **TestVariable**. For example, if this service was deployed to Node 2, then you can go to this path for the **MyApplicationType**:

```
C:\SfDevCluster\Data\_App\Node.2\MyApplicationType_App\work\out.txt
```

### <a name="configure-the-policy-by-using-local-system-accounts"></a>Configure the policy by using local system accounts
Often, it's preferable to run the startup script by using a local system account rather than an administrator account. Running the RunAs policy as a member of the Administrators group typically doesn’t work well because machines have User Access Control (UAC) enabled by default. In such cases, **the recommendation is to run the SetupEntryPoint as LocalSystem, instead of as a local user added to Administrators group**. The following example shows setting the SetupEntryPoint to run as LocalSystem:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
   <ServiceManifestImport>
      <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyServiceTypePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
      <ConfigOverrides />
      <Policies>
         <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupLocalSystem" EntryPointType="Setup" />
      </Policies>
   </ServiceManifestImport>
   <Principals>
      <Users>
         <User Name="SetupLocalSystem" AccountType="LocalSystem" />
      </Users>
   </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
```

## <a name="start-powershell-commands-from-a-setup-entry-point"></a>Start PowerShell commands from a setup entry point
To run PowerShell from the **SetupEntryPoint** point, you can run **PowerShell.exe** in a batch file that points to a PowerShell file. First, add a PowerShell file to the service project--for example, **MySetup.ps1**. Remember to set the *Copy if newer* property so that the file is also included in the service package. The following example shows a sample batch file that starts a PowerShell file called MySetup.ps1, which sets a system environment variable called **TestVariable**.

MySetup.bat to start a PowerShell file:

```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ".\MySetup.ps1"
```

In the PowerShell file, add the following to set a system environment variable:

```
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable", "MyValue", "Machine")
[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine") > out.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, when the batch file runs, it looks at the application folder called **work** for files. In this case, when MySetup.bat runs, we want this to find the MySetup.ps1 file in the same folder, which is the application **code package** folder. To change this folder, set the working folder:
> 
> 

```xml
<SetupEntryPoint>
    <ExeHost>
    <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
    <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
    </ExeHost>
</SetupEntryPoint>
```

## <a name="use-console-redirection-for-local-debugging"></a>Use console redirection for local debugging
Occasionally, it's useful to see the console output from running a script for debugging purposes. To do this, you can set a console redirection policy, which writes the output to a file. The file output is written to the application folder called **log** on the node where the application is deployed and run. (See where to find this in the preceding example.)

> [!WARNING]
> Never use the console redirection policy in an application that is deployed in production because this can affect the application failover. *Only* use this for local development and debugging purposes.  
> 
> 

The following example shows setting the console redirection with a FileRetentionCount value:

```xml
<SetupEntryPoint>
    <ExeHost>
    <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
    <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
    <ConsoleRedirection FileRetentionCount="10"/>
    </ExeHost>
</SetupEntryPoint>
```

If you now change the MySetup.ps1 file to write an **Echo** command, this will write to the output file for debugging purposes:

```
Echo "Test console redirection which writes to the application log folder on the node that the application is deployed to"
```

**After you debug your script, immediately remove this console redirection policy**.

## <a name="configure-a-policy-for-service-code-packages"></a>Configure a policy for service code packages
In the preceding steps, you saw how to apply a RunAs policy to SetupEntryPoint. Let's look a little deeper into how to create different principals that can be applied as service policies.

### <a name="create-local-user-groups"></a>Create local user groups
You can define and create user groups that allow one or more users to be added to a group. This is particularly useful if there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level. The following example shows a local group called **LocalAdminGroup** that has administrator privileges. Two users, Customer1 and Customer2, are made members of this local group.

```xml
<Principals>
 <Groups>
   <Group Name="LocalAdminGroup">
     <Membership>
       <SystemGroup Name="Administrators"/>
     </Membership>
   </Group>
 </Groups>
  <Users>
     <User Name="Customer1">
        <MemberOf>
           <Group NameRef="LocalAdminGroup" />
        </MemberOf>
     </User>
    <User Name="Customer2">
      <MemberOf>
        <Group NameRef="LocalAdminGroup" />
      </MemberOf>
    </User>
  </Users>
</Principals>
```

### <a name="create-local-users"></a>Create local users
You can create a local user that can be used to help secure a service within the application. When a **LocalUser** account type is specified in the principals section of the application manifest, Service Fabric creates local user accounts on machines where the application is deployed. By default, these accounts do not have the same names as those specified in the application manifest (for example, Customer3 in the following sample). Instead, they are dynamically generated and have random passwords.

```xml
<Principals>
  <Users>
     <User Name="Customer3" AccountType="LocalUser" />
  </Users>
</Principals>
```

If an application requires that the user account and password be same on all machines (for example, to enable NTLM authentication), the cluster manifest must set NTLMAuthenticationEnabled to true. The cluster manifest must also specify an NTLMAuthenticationPasswordSecret that will be used to generate the same password across all machines.

```xml
<Section Name="Hosting">
      <Parameter Name="EndpointProviderEnabled" Value="true"/>
      <Parameter Name="NTLMAuthenticationEnabled" Value="true"/>
      <Parameter Name="NTLMAuthenticationPassworkSecret" Value="******" IsEncrypted="true"/>
 </Section>
```

### <a name="assign-policies-to-the-service-code-packages"></a>Assign policies to the service code packages
The **RunAsPolicy** section for a **ServiceManifestImport** specifies the account from the principals section that should be used to run a code package. It also associates code packages from the service manifest with user accounts in the principals section. You can specify this for the setup or main entry points, or you can specify `All` to apply it to both. The following example shows different policies being applied:

```xml
<Policies>
<RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="LocalAdmin" EntryPointType="Setup"/>
<RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="Customer3" EntryPointType="Main"/>
</Policies>
```

If **EntryPointType** is not specified, the default is set to EntryPointType=”Main”. Specifying **SetupEntryPoint** is especially useful when you want to run certain high-privilege setup operations under a system account. The actual service code can run under a lower-privilege account.

### <a name="apply-a-default-policy-to-all-service-code-packages"></a>Apply a default policy to all service code packages
You use the **DefaultRunAsPolicy** section to specify a default user account for all code packages that don’t have a specific **RunAsPolicy** defined. If most of the code packages that are specified in the service manifest used by an application need to run under the same user, the application can just define a default RunAs policy with that user account. The following example specifies that if a code package does not have a **RunAsPolicy** specified, the code package should run under the **MyDefaultAccount** specified in the principals section.

```xml
<Policies>
  <DefaultRunAsPolicy UserRef="MyDefaultAccount"/>
</Policies>
```
### <a name="use-an-active-directory-domain-group-or-user"></a>Use an Active Directory domain group or user
For an instance of Service Fabric that was installed on Windows Server by using the standalone installer, you can run the service under the credentials for an Active Directory user or group account. Note that this is Active Directory on-premises within your domain and is not with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). By using a domain user or group, you can then access other resources in the domain (for example, file shares) that have been granted permissions.

The following example shows an Active Directory user called *TestUser* with their domain password encrypted by using a certificate called *MyCert*. You can use the `Invoke-ServiceFabricEncryptText` PowerShell command to create the secret cipher text. See [Managing secrets in Service Fabric applications](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md) for details.

You must deploy the private key of the certificate to decrypt the password to the local machine by using an out-of-band method (in Azure, this is via Azure Resource Manager). Then, when Service Fabric deploys the service package to the machine, it is able to decrypt the secret and (along with the user name) authenticate with Active Directory to run under those credentials.

```xml
<Principals>
  <Users>
    <User Name="TestUser" AccountType="DomainUser" AccountName="Domain\User" Password="[Put encrypted password here using MyCert certificate]" PasswordEncrypted="true" />
  </Users>
</Principals>
<Policies>
  <DefaultRunAsPolicy UserRef="TestUser" />
  <SecurityAccessPolicies>
    <SecurityAccessPolicy ResourceRef="MyCert" PrincipalRef="TestUser" GrantRights="Full" ResourceType="Certificate" />
  </SecurityAccessPolicies>
</Policies>
<Certificates>
```


## <a name="assign-a-security-access-policy-for-http-and-https-endpoints"></a>Assign a security access policy for HTTP and HTTPS endpoints
If you apply a RunAs policy to a service and the service manifest declares endpoint resources with the HTTP protocol, you must specify a **SecurityAccessPolicy** to ensure that ports allocated to these endpoints are correctly access-control listed for the RunAs user account that the service runs under. Otherwise, **http.sys** does not have access to the service, and you get failures with calls from the client. The following example applies the Customer3 account to an endpoint called **ServiceEndpointName**, which gives it full access rights.

```xml
<Policies>
   <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="Customer1" />
   <!--SecurityAccessPolicy is needed if RunAsPolicy is defined and the Endpoint is http -->
   <SecurityAccessPolicy ResourceRef="EndpointName" PrincipalRef="Customer1" />
</Policies>
```

For the HTTPS endpoint, you also have to indicate the name of the certificate to return to the client. You can do this by using **EndpointBindingPolicy**, with the certificate defined in a certificates section in the application manifest.

```xml
<Policies>
   <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="Customer1" />
  <!--SecurityAccessPolicy is needed if RunAsPolicy is defined and the Endpoint is http -->
   <SecurityAccessPolicy ResourceRef="EndpointName" PrincipalRef="Customer1" />
  <!--EndpointBindingPolicy is needed if the EndpointName is secured with https -->
  <EndpointBindingPolicy EndpointRef="EndpointName" CertificateRef="Cert1" />
</Policies
```
