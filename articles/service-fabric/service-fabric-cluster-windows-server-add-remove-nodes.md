# <a name="add-or-remove-nodes-to-a-standalone-service-fabric-cluster-running-on-windows-server"></a>Add or remove nodes to a standalone Service Fabric cluster running on Windows Server
After you have [created your standalone Service Fabric cluster on Windows Server machines](service-fabric-cluster-creation-for-windows-server.md), your business needs may change so that you might need to add or remove multiple nodes to your cluster. This article provides detailed steps to achieve this goal.

## <a name="add-nodes-to-your-cluster"></a>Add nodes to your cluster
1. Prepare the VM/machine you want to add to your cluster by following the steps mentioned in the [Prepare the machines to meet the prerequisites for cluster deployment](service-fabric-cluster-creation-for-windows-server.md) section.
2. Plan which fault domain and upgrade domain you are going to add this VM/machine to.
3. Remote desktop (RDP) into the VM/machine that you want to add to the cluster.
4. Copy or [download the standalone package for Service Fabric for Windows Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=730690) to this VM/machine and unzip the package.
5. Run Powershell as an administrator, and navigate to the location of the unzipped package.
6. Run *AddNode.ps1* Powershell with the parameters describing the new node to add. The example below adds a new node called VM5, with type NodeType0, IP address 182.17.34.52 into UD1 and fd:/dc1/r0. The *ExistingClusterConnectionEndPoint* is a connection endpoint for a node already in the existing cluster. For this endpoint, you can choose the IP address of *any* node in the cluster.

```
.\AddNode.ps1 -NodeName VM5 -NodeType NodeType0 -NodeIPAddressorFQDN 182.17.34.52 -ExistingClientConnectionEndpoint 182.17.34.50:19000 -UpgradeDomain UD1 -FaultDomain fd:/dc1/r0 -AcceptEULA

```
You can check if the new node is added by running the cmdlet [Get-ServiceFabricNode](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/Get-ServiceFabricNode).


## <a name="remove-nodes-from-your-cluster"></a>Remove nodes from your cluster
Depending on the Reliability level chosen for the cluster, you cannot remove the first n (3/5/7/9) nodes of the primary node type. Also note that running RemoveNode command on a dev cluster is not supported.

1. Remote desktop (RDP) into the VM/machine that you want to remove from the cluster.
2. Copy or [download the standalone package for Service Fabric for Windows Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=730690) and unzip the package to this VM/machine.
3. Run Powershell as an administrator, and navigate to the location of the unzipped package.
4. Run *RemoveNode.ps1* in PowerShell. The example below removes the current node from the cluster. The *ExistingClientConnectionEndpoint* is a client connection endpoint for any node that will remain in the cluster. Choose the IP address and the endpoint port of *any* **other node** in the cluster. This **other node** will in turn update the cluster configuration for the removed node. 

```

.\RemoveNode.ps1 -ExistingClientConnectionEndpoint 182.17.34.50:19000

```

> [!NOTE]
> Some nodes may not be removed due to system services dependencies. These nodes are primary nodes and can be identified by querying the cluster manifest using `Get-ServiceFabricClusterManifest` and finding node entries marked with `IsSeedNode=”true”`. 
> 
> 

Even after removing a node, if it shows up as being down in queries and SFX, please note that this is a known defect. It will be fixed in an upcoming release. 


## <a name="remove-node-types-from-your-cluster"></a>Remove node types from your cluster
Removing a node type requires extra caution. Before removing a node type, please double check if there is any node referencing the node type.


## <a name="replace-primary-nodes-of-your-cluster"></a>Replace primary nodes of your cluster
The replacement of primary nodes should be performed one node after another, instead of removing and then adding in batches.
