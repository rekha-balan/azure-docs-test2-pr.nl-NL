# <a name="microsoft-security-response-center"></a>Microsoft Security Response Center
The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) is led by some of the world’s most experienced security experts. These experts identify, monitor, respond to and resolve security incidents and on-premises and cloud vulnerabilities around the clock, each day of the year.

In addition to the continuous work the MSRC does in the background, the MSRC team has a number of resources available to you so that you can understand how to secure your Azure assets and deployments more effectively.

## <a name="the-msrc-blog"></a>The MSRC Blog
The [MSRC blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/) is the place to go to get the latest news on what the MSRC is doing to help protect you against cloud threats.

## <a name="white-papers"></a>White Papers
The MSRC has published a number of [white papers](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb969102.aspx) that will help you understand what they do and how they do it. Some provide insights into how we secure the Microsoft cloud and include useful information on how you can employ the same security configurations.

## <a name="security-researcher-engagement-and-bounty-programs"></a>Security Researcher Engagement and Bounty Programs
The MSRC supports collaboration and relationships with security researchers globally to advance Microsoft product security.

Microsoft bounty programs pay researchers for novel exploitation techniques, defensive ideas that mitigate novel exploitations, and identification of critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft on-premises and cloud software.

Learn more about these programs at the [MSRC Bug Bounty](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/dn425036) page and the [MSRC blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/).
