# <a name="examples-and-common-scenarios-for-azure-logic-apps"></a>Examples and common scenarios for Azure Logic Apps

To help you learn more about the many patterns and capabilities in Azure Logic Apps, here are common examples and scenarios.

## <a name="key-scenarios-for-logic-apps"></a>Key scenarios for logic apps

Azure Logic Apps provides resilient orchestration and integration for different services. The Logic Apps service is "serverless", so you don't have to worry about scale or instances - all you have to do is define the workflow (trigger and actions). The underlying platform handles scale, availability, and performance. Any scenario where you need to coordinate multiple actions, especially across multiple systems, is a great use case for Azure Logic Apps. Here are some patterns and examples.

## <a name="respond-to-triggers-and-extend-actions"></a>Respond to triggers and extend actions

Every logic app begins with a trigger. For example, your workflow can start with a schedule event, a manual invocation, or an event from an external system, such as the "when a file is added to an FTP server" trigger. Azure Logic Apps currently supports over 100 ready-to-use connectors, ranging from on-premises SAP to Azure Cognitive Services. For systems and services that might not have published connectors, you can also extend logic apps.

* [Create custom triggers or actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md)
* [Set up long-running actions for workflow runs](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md)
* [Respond to external events and actions with webhooks](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md)
* [Call, trigger, or nest workflows with synchronous responses to HTTP requests](logic-apps-http-endpoint.md)

## <a name="error-handling-logging-and-control-flow-capabilities"></a>Error handling, logging, and control flow capabilities

Logic apps include rich capabilities for advanced control flow, like conditions, switches, loops, and scopes. To ensure resilient solutions, you can also implement error and exception handling in your workflows. For notification and diagnostic logs for workflow run status, Azure Logic Apps also provides monitoring and alerts.

* [Configure Azure Alerts and diagnostics](logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps.md)

## <a name="deploy-and-manage-logic-apps"></a>Deploy and manage logic apps

You can fully develop and deploy logic apps with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Team Services, or any other source control and automated build tools. To support deployment for workflows and dependent connections in a resource template, logic apps use Azure resource deployment templates. Visual Studio tools automatically generate these templates, which you can check in to source control for versioning.

* [Create an automated deployment template](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-deploy-template.md)
* [Build and deploy logic apps from Visual Studio](logic-apps-deploy-from-vs.md)
* [Monitor the health of your logic apps](logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps.md)

## <a name="content-types-conversions-and-transformations-within-a-run"></a>Content types, conversions, and transformations within a run

You can access, convert, and transform multiple content types by using the many functions in the Azure Logic Apps [workflow definition language](http://aka.ms/logicappsdocs). For example, you can convert between a string, JSON, and XML with the `@json()` and `@xml()` workflow expressions. The Logic Apps engine preserves content types to support content transfer in a lossless manner between services.

* [Handle non-JSON content types](../logic-apps/logic-apps-content-type.md), like `application/xml`, `application/octet-stream`, and `multipart/formdata`

## <a name="other-integrations-and-capabilities"></a>Other integrations and capabilities

Logic apps also offer integration with many services, like Azure Functions, Azure API Management, Azure App Services, and custom HTTP endpoints, for example, REST and SOAP.
