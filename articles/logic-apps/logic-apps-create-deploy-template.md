# <a name="create-templates-for-logic-apps-deployment-and-release-management"></a>Create templates for logic apps deployment and release management

After a logic app has been created, you might want to create it as an Azure Resource Manager template. This way, you can easily deploy the logic app to any environment or resource group where you might need it. For more about Resource Manager templates, see [authoring Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates.md) and [deploying resources by using Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md).

## <a name="logic-app-deployment-template"></a>Logic app deployment template

A logic app has three basic components:

* **Logic app resource**: Contains information about things like pricing plan, location, and the workflow definition.
* **Workflow definition**: Describes your logic app's workflow steps and how the Logic Apps engine should execute the workflow. You can view this definition in your logic app's **Code View** window. In the logic app resource, you can find this definition in the `definition` property.
* **Connections**: Refers to separate resources that securely store metadata about any connector connections, such as a connection string and an access token. In the logic app resource, your logic app references these resources in the `parameters` section.

You can view all these pieces of existing logic apps by using a tool like [Azure Resource Explorer](http://resources.azure.com).

To make a template for a logic app to use with resource group deployments, you must define the resources and parameterize as needed. For example, if you're deploying to a development, test, and production environment, you likely want to use different connection strings to a SQL database in each environment. Or, you might want to deploy within different subscriptions or resource groups.  

## <a name="create-a-logic-app-deployment-template"></a>Create a logic app deployment template

The easiest way to have a valid logic app deployment template is to use the [Visual Studio Tools for Logic Apps](logic-apps-deploy-from-vs.md). The Visual Studio tools generate a valid deployment template that can be used across any subscription or location.

A few other tools can assist you as you create a logic app deployment template. You can author by hand, that is, by using the resources already discussed here to create parameters as needed. Another option is to use a [logic app template creator](https://github.com/jeffhollan/LogicAppTemplateCreator) PowerShell module. This open-source module first evaluates the logic app and any connections that it is using, and then generates template resources with the necessary parameters for deployment. For example, if you have a logic app that receives a message from an Azure Service Bus queue and adds data to an Azure SQL database, the tool preserves all the orchestration logic and parameterizes the SQL and Service Bus connection strings so that they can be set at deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> Connections must be within the same resource group as the logic app.

### <a name="install-the-logic-app-template-powershell-module"></a>Install the logic app template PowerShell module
The easiest way to install the module is via the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/LogicAppTemplate/0.1), by using the command `Install-Module -Name LogicAppTemplate`.  

You also can install the PowerShell module manually:

1. Download the latest release of the [logic app template creator](https://github.com/jeffhollan/LogicAppTemplateCreator/releases).  
2. Extract the folder in your PowerShell module folder (usually `%UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`).

For the module to work with any tenant and subscription access token, we recommend that you use it with the [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient) command-line tool.  This [blog post](http://blog.davidebbo.com/2015/01/azure-resource-manager-client.html) discusses ARMClient in more detail.

### <a name="generate-a-logic-app-template-by-using-powershell"></a>Generate a logic app template by using PowerShell
After PowerShell is installed, you can generate a template by using the following command:

`armclient token $SubscriptionId | Get-LogicAppTemplate -LogicApp MyApp -ResourceGroup MyRG -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId -Verbose | Out-File C:\template.json`

`$SubscriptionId` is the Azure subscription ID. This line first gets an access token via ARMClient, then pipes it through to the PowerShell script, and then creates the template in a JSON file.

## <a name="add-parameters-to-a-logic-app-template"></a>Add parameters to a logic app template
After you create your logic app template, you can continue to add or modify parameters that you might need. For example, if your definition includes a resource ID to an Azure function or nested workflow that you plan to deploy in a single deployment, you can add more resources to your template and parameterize IDs as needed. The same applies to any references to custom APIs or Swagger endpoints you expect to deploy with each resource group.

## <a name="deploy-a-logic-app-template"></a>Deploy a logic app template

You can deploy your template by using any tools like PowerShell, REST API, [Visual Studio Team Services Release Management](#team-services), and template deployment through the Azure portal. Also, to store the values for parameters, we recommend that you create a [parameter file](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md#parameters).
Learn how to [deploy resources with Azure Resource Manager templates and PowerShell](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md) or [deploy resources with Azure Resource Manager templates and the Azure portal](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal.md).

### <a name="authorize-oauth-connections"></a>Authorize OAuth connections

After deployment, the logic app works end-to-end with valid parameters. However, you must still authorize OAuth connections to generate a valid access token. To authorize OAuth connections, open the logic app in the Logic Apps Designer, and authorize these connections. Or for automated deployment, you can use a script to consent to each OAuth connection. There's an example script on GitHub under the [LogicAppConnectionAuth](https://github.com/logicappsio/LogicAppConnectionAuth) project.

<a name="team-services"></a>
## <a name="visual-studio-team-services-release-management"></a>Visual Studio Team Services Release Management

A common scenario for deploying and managing an environment is to use a tool like Release Management in Visual Studio Team Services, with a logic app deployment template. Visual Studio Team Services includes a [Deploy Azure Resource Group](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/DeployAzureResourceGroup) task that you can add to any build or release pipeline. You need to have a [service principal](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/10/04/automating-azure-resource-group-deployment-using-a-service-principal-in-visual-studio-online-buildrelease-management/) for authorization to deploy, and then you can generate the release definition.

1. In Release Management, select **Empty** so that you create an empty definition.

    ![Create empty definition][1]

2. Choose any resources you need for this, most likely including the logic app template that is generated manually or as part of the build process.
3. Add an **Azure Resource Group Deployment** task.
4. Configure with a [service principal](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/10/04/automating-azure-resource-group-deployment-using-a-service-principal-in-visual-studio-online-buildrelease-management/), and reference the Template and Template Parameters files.
5. Continue to build out steps in the release process for any other environment, automated test, or approvers as needed.
