# <a name="what-is-microsoft-genomics"></a>What is Microsoft Genomics?
Microsoft Genomics offers a cloud implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) for secondary analysis. The service is ISO-certified and compliant with HIPAA regulations, and offers price predictability for your genome sequencing needs. Learn how to use the Microsoft Genomics service and integrate with our API by reading our quickstarts, tutorials, and documentation.
