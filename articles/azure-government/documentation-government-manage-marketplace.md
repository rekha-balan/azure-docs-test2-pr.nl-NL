# <a name="azure-marketplace-for-government"></a>Azure Marketplace for Government
The Azure Marketplace is available for Azure Government with an updated list of images from our marketplace publishers. 

## <a name="variations"></a>Variations
Below are some considerations when using Azure Marketplace for Government:

* Only Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images are available. You cannot access any images that require purchase transaction through Azure Marketplace
* Only a subset of images is currently available as compared to the public marketplace. You can find the list of available images [here](../azure-government-image-gallery.md) 
* Before provisioning an image, your Enterprise Administrator must enable Marketplace purchases for your Azure subscription
  * Log in to the Portal as an Enterprise Administrator
  * Navigate to *Manage*
  * Under *Enrollment Details* click the pencil icon next to the *Azure Marketplace* line item
  * Toggle *Enabled/Disabled* as appropriate
  * Click *Save*

> [!NOTE]
> If you are interested in making your images available in Azure Government please refer to [partner onboarding guidelines](documentation-government-manage-marketplace-partners.md) for more information.
