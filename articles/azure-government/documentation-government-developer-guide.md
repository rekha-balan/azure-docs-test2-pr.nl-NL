# <a name="azure-government-developer-guide"></a>Azure Government developer guide
The Azure Government environment is a physical instance that is separate from the rest of the Microsoft network. This guide discusses the differences that application developers and administrators must understand to interact and work with separate regions of Azure.

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
Azure Government is a separate instance of the Microsoft Azure service. It addresses the security and compliance needs of United States federal agencies, state and local governments, and their solution providers. Azure Government offers physical isolation from non-US government deployments and provides screened US personnel.

Microsoft provides various tools to help developers create and deploy cloud applications to the global Microsoft Azure service (“global service”) and Microsoft Azure Government services.

When developers create and deploy applications to Azure Government services, as opposed to the global service, they need to know the key differences between the two services. The specific areas to understand are: setting up and configuring their programming environment, configuring endpoints, writing applications, and deploying the applications as services to Azure Government.

The information in this document summarizes the differences between the two services. It supplements the information that's available on the [Azure Government](http://www.azure.com/gov "Azure Government") site and the [Microsoft Azure Technical Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/cloud-app-development-msdn "MSDN") on MSDN. Official information might also be available in other locations, such as the [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/trust-center/ "Microsoft Azure Trust Center"), [Azure Documentation Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/), and [Azure Blogs](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/ "Azure Blogs").

This content is intended for partners and developers who are deploying to Microsoft Azure Government.

## <a name="guidance-for-developers"></a>Guidance for developers
Most of the currently available technical content assumes that applications are being developed for the global service rather than for Azure Government. For this reason, it’s important to be aware of two key differences in applications that you develop for hosting in Azure Government.

* Certain services and features that are in specific regions of the global service might not be available in Azure Government.
* Feature configurations in Azure Government might differ from those in the global service. Therefore, it's important to review your sample code, configurations, and steps to ensure that you are building and executing within the Azure Government Cloud Services environment.

Currently, US GOV Iowa and US GOV Virginia are the datacenters that support Azure Government. For current datacenters and available services, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services).


## <a name="endpoint-mapping"></a>Endpoint mapping
To learn about mapping public Azure and SQL Database endpoints to Azure Government-specific endpoints, see the following table:

| Name | Azure Government endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| ActiveDirectoryServiceEndpointResourceId  | https://management.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ |
| GalleryUrl | https://gallery.usgovcloudapi.net/ |
| ManagementPortalUrl | https://manage.windowsazure.us |
| ServiceManagementUrl | https://management.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ |
| PublishSettingsFileUrl | https://manage.windowsazure.us/publishsettings/index |
| ResourceManagerUrl | https://management.usgovcloudapi.net/ |
| SqlDatabaseDnsSuffix | .database.usgovcloudapi.net |
| StorageEndpointSuffix | core.usgovcloudapi.net |
| ActiveDirectoryAuthority | https://login.microsoftonline.us/ |
| GraphUrl | https://graph.windows.net/ |
| GraphEndpointResourceId | https://graph.windows.net/ |
| TrafficManagerDnsSuffix | usgovtrafficmanager.net |
| AzureKeyVaultDnsSuffix | vault.usgovcloudapi.net |
| AzureKeyVaultServiceEndpointResourceId | https://vault.usgovcloudapi.net |

> [!NOTE]
> The **ActiveDirectoryAuthority** for Azure Government has changed from https://login-us.microsoftonline.com to https://login.microsoftonline.us.  The original URL will continue to work but all applications should be updated to the new authority URL.
