# <a name="assign-variables-in-sql-data-warehouse"></a>Assign variables in SQL Data Warehouse
Variables in SQL Data Warehouse are set using the `DECLARE` statement or the `SET` statement.

All of the following are perfectly valid ways to set a variable value:

## <a name="setting-variables-with-declare"></a>Setting variables with DECLARE
Initializing variables with DECLARE is one of the most flexible ways to set a variable value in SQL Data Warehouse.

```sql
DECLARE @v  int = 0
;
```

You can also use DECLARE to set more than one variable at a time. You cannot use `SELECT` or `UPDATE` to do this:

```sql
DECLARE @v  INT = (SELECT TOP 1 c_customer_sk FROM Customer where c_last_name = 'Smith')
,       @v1 INT = (SELECT TOP 1 c_customer_sk FROM Customer where c_last_name = 'Jones')
;
```

You cannot initialise and use a variable in the same DECLARE statement. To illustrate the point the example below is **not** allowed as @p1 is both initialized and used in the same DECLARE statement. This will result in an error.

```sql
DECLARE @p1 int = 0
,       @p2 int = (SELECT COUNT (*) FROM sys.types where is_user_defined = @p1 )
;
```

## <a name="setting-values-with-set"></a>Setting values with SET
Set is a very common method for setting a single variable.

All of the examples below are valid ways of setting a variable with SET:

```sql
SET     @v = (Select max(database_id) from sys.databases);
SET     @v = 1;
SET     @v = @v+1;
SET     @v +=1;
```

You can only set one variable at a time with SET. However, as can be seen above compound operators are permissable.

## <a name="limitations"></a>Limitations
You cannot use SELECT or UPDATE for variable assignment.
