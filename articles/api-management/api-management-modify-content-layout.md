# <a name="modify-the-content-and-layout-of-pages-on-the-developer-portal-in-azure-api-management"></a>Modify the content and layout of pages on the developer portal in Azure API Management
There are three fundamental ways to customize the developer portal in Azure API Management:

* [Edit the contents of static pages and page layout elements][modify-content-layout] (explained in this guide)
* [Update the styles used for page elements across the developer portal][customize-styles]
* [Modify the templates used for pages generated by the portal][portal-templates] (e.g. API docs, products, user authentication, etc.)

## <a name="page-structure"> </a>Structure of developer portal pages

The developer portal is based on a content management system. The layout of every page is built based on set of small page elements known as widgets:

![Developer portal page structure][api-management-customization-widget-structure]

All widgets are editable. 
* The core contents specific to each individual page reside in the "Contents" widget. Editing a page means editing the contents of this widget.
* All page layout elements are contained with the remaining widgets. Changes made to these widgets will apply to all pages. They will be referred to as "layout widgets".

In day-to-day page editing one usually only modifies the Content widget which will have different content for each individual page.

## <a name="modify-layout-widget"> </a>Modifying the contents of a layout widget

Content within the developer portal is modified via the publisher portal which is accessible from the Azure Portal. To reach it, click **Publisher portal** from the service toolbar of your API Management instance.

![Publisher portal][api-management-management-console]

To edit the contents of that widget, click **Widgets** from the **Developer Portal** menu on the left. For this example lets modify the contents of the Header widget. Select the **Header** widget from the list.

![Widgets header][api-management-widgets-header]

The contents of the header is editable from within the **Body** field. Change the text as desired and then click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

Now you should be able to see the new header on every page within the developer portal.

> To open the developer portal while in the publisher portal, click **Developer portal** in the top bar.

## <a name="edit-page-contents"> </a>Edit the contents of a page

To see the list of all existing content pages, click **Content** from the **Developer portal** menu in the publisher portal.

![Manage content][api-management-customization-manage-content]

Click the **Welcome** page to edit what is displayed on the home page of the developer portal. Make the changes you want, preview them if necessary, and then click **Publish Now** to make them visible to everyone.

> The home page uses a special layout that allows it to display a banner at the top. This banner is not editable from the **Content** section. To edit this banner, click **Widgets** from the **Developer portal** menu, select **Home page** from the **Current Layer** drop-down list, and then open the **Banner** item under the **Featured section**. The contents of this widget are editable just like any other page.
