# <a name="customize-the-styling-of-the-developer-portal-in-azure-api-management"></a>Customize the styling of the developer portal in Azure API Management
There are three fundamental ways to customize the developer portal in Azure API Management:

* [Edit the contents of static pages and page layout elements][modify-content-layout]
* [Update the styles used for page elements across the developer portal][customize-styles] (explained in this guide)
* [Modify the templates used for pages generated by the portal][portal-templates] (e.g. API docs, products, user authentication, etc.)

## <a name="change-headers-styling"> </a>Change the styling of page elements

The colors, fonts, sizes, spacings, and other style-related elements of any page on the portal are defined by style rules. 

Editing the style rules is done from the **Developer portal** while being logged in as an administrator. To get there first open the Azure Portal and click **Publisher portal** from the service toolbar of your API Management instance.

![Publisher portal][api-management-management-console]

Then click on **Developer portal** on the top-right. 

![Developer portal link on the publisher portal][api-management-pp-dp-link]

To open the customization toolbar move your mouse over the customization icon (or select it) and then click "styles" from the toolbar.

![Customization toolbar button][api-management-customization-toolbar-button]

There are two main way of editing styling rules - you can look through the list of all the style rules used anywhere which is displayed by default and modify a style as needed, or you can choose **Select an element on the page** and then click anywhere on the page to see only the styles for that element.

![Customization toolbar][api-management-customization-toolbar]

Click the **Select an element on the page** option for this example.  Elements now become highlighted as you hover over them with the mouse to signify what element's styles you would start editing if you clicked. Move the mouse over the text in the header (typically you have the company name here), and then click it. A set of named and categorized styling rules appears within the styling editor. Each rule represents a styling property of the selected element. For example, for the header text selected above, the size of the text is in @font-size-h1 while the name of the font with alternatives is in @headings-font-family.

> If you're familiar with [bootstrap][bootstrap], these rules are in fact [LESS variables][LESS variables] within the bootstrap theme used by the developer portal.
> 
> 

Let's change the color of the heading text. Select the entry in the **@headings-color** field and type **#000000**. This is the hex code for the color black. As you do this, you see that a square color indicator appears at the end of the text box. If you click this indicator, a color picker lets you to choose a color.

![Color picker][api-management-customization-toolbar-color-picker]

Changes are previewed in real time as you make them, but are visible only to administrators. To make these changes visible to everyone, click the **Publish** button in the styling editor and confirm the changes.

![Publish menu][api-management-customization-toolbar-publish-form]

> To change the style rules that apply to any other element on the page, follow the same procedure as you did for the header. Click **Select an element on the page** from the styling editor, select the element you are interested in, and start modifying the values of the style rules displayed on the screen.
