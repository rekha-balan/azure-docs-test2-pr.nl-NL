# <a name="move-data-from-amazon-redshift-using-azure-data-factory"></a>Move data From Amazon Redshift using Azure Data Factory
This article explains how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to move data from Amazon Redshift. The article builds on the [Data Movement Activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, which presents a general overview of data movement with the copy activity. 

You can copy data from Amazon Redshift to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores supported as sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table. Data factory currently supports only moving data from Amazon Redshift to other data stores, but not for moving data from other data stores to Amazon Redshift.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
* If you are moving data to an on-premises data store, install [Data Management Gateway](data-factory-data-management-gateway.md) on an on-premises machine. Then, Grant Data Management Gateway (use IP address of the machine) the access to Amazon Redshift cluster. See [Authorize access to the cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/rs-gsg-authorize-cluster-access.html) for instructions.
* If you are moving data to an Azure data store, see [Azure Data Center IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) for the Compute IP address ranges (including SQL ranges) used by the Microsoft Azure data centers.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting started
You can create a pipeline with a copy activity that moves data from an Amazon Redshift source by using different tools/APIs.

The easiest way to create a pipeline is to use the **Copy Wizard**. See [Tutorial: Create a pipeline using Copy Wizard](data-factory-copy-data-wizard-tutorial.md) for a quick walkthrough on creating a pipeline using the Copy data wizard.

You can also use the following tools to create a pipeline: **Azure portal**, **Visual Studio**, **Azure PowerShell**, **Azure Resource Manager template**, **.NET API**, and **REST API**. See [Copy activity tutorial](data-factory-copy-data-from-azure-blob-storage-to-sql-database.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity. 

Whether you use the tools or APIs, you perform the following steps to create a pipeline that moves data from a source data store to a sink data store: 

1. Create **linked services** to link input and output data stores to your data factory.
2. Create **datasets** to represent input and output data for the copy operation. 
3. Create a **pipeline** with a copy activity that takes a dataset as an input and a dataset as an output. 

When you use the wizard, JSON definitions for these Data Factory entities (linked services, datasets, and the pipeline) are automatically created for you. When you use tools/APIs (except .NET API), you define these Data Factory entities by using the JSON format.  For a sample with JSON definitions for Data Factory entities that are used to copy data from an Amazon Redshift data store, see [JSON example: Copy data from Amazon Redshift to Azure Blob](#json-example-copy-data-from-amazon-redshift-to-azure-blob) section of this article. 

The following sections provide details about JSON properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Amazon Redshift: 

## <a name="linked-service-properties"></a>Linked service properties
The following table provides description for JSON elements specific to Amazon Redshift linked service.

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type |The type property must be set to: **AmazonRedshift**. |Yes |
| server |IP address or host name of the Amazon Redshift server. |Yes |
| port |The number of the TCP port that the Amazon Redshift server uses to listen for client connections. |No, default value: 5439 |
| database |Name of the Amazon Redshift database. |Yes |
| username |Name of user who has access to the database. |Yes |
| password |Password for the user account. |Yes |

## <a name="dataset-properties"></a>Dataset properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections such as structure, availability, and policy are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc.).

The **typeProperties** section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The typeProperties section for dataset of type **RelationalTable** (which includes Amazon Redshift dataset) has the following properties

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tableName |Name of the table in the Amazon Redshift database that linked service refers to. |No (if **query** of **RelationalSource** is specified) |

## <a name="copy-activity-properties"></a>Copy activity properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties such as name, description, input and output tables, and policies are available for all types of activities.

Properties available in the **typeProperties** section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type. For Copy activity, they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

When source of copy activity is of type **RelationalSource** (which includes Amazon Redshift) the following properties are available in typeProperties section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| query |Use the custom query to read data. |SQL query string. For example: select * from MyTable. |No (if **tableName** of **dataset** is specified) |

## <a name="json-example-copy-data-from-amazon-redshift-to-azure-blob"></a>JSON example: Copy data from Amazon Redshift to Azure Blob
This sample shows how to copy data from an Amazon Redshift database to an Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

The sample has the following data factory entities:

* A linked service of type [AmazonRedshift](#linked-service-properties).
* A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#linked-service-properties).
* An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [RelationalTable](#dataset-properties).
* An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#dataset-properties).
* A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [RelationalSource](#copy-activity-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md##copy-activity-properties).

The sample copies data from a query result in Amazon Redshift to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**Amazon Redshift linked service:**

```json
{
    "name": "AmazonRedshiftLinkedService",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "AmazonRedshift",
        "typeProperties":
        {
            "server": "< The IP address or host name of the Amazon Redshift server >",
            "port": <The number of the TCP port that the Amazon Redshift server uses to listen for client connections.>,
            "database": "<The database name of the Amazon Redshift database>",
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": "<password>"
        }
    }
}
```

**Azure Storage linked service:**

```json
{
  "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureStorage",
    "typeProperties": {
      "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
    }
  }
}
```
**Amazon Redshift input dataset:**

Setting **"external": true** informs the Data Factory service that the dataset is external to the data factory and is not produced by an activity in the data factory. Set this property to true on an input dataset that is not produced by an activity in the pipeline.

```json
{
    "name": "AmazonRedshiftInputDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "RelationalTable",
        "linkedServiceName": "AmazonRedshiftLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
            "tableName": "<Table name>"
        },
        "availability": {
            "frequency": "Hour",
            "interval": 1
        },
        "external": true
    }
}
```

**Azure Blob output dataset:**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

```json
{
    "name": "AzureBlobOutputDataSet",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
            "folderPath": "mycontainer/fromamazonredshift/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "rowDelimiter": "\n",
                "columnDelimiter": "\t"
            },
            "partitionedBy": [
                {
                    "name": "Year",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "yyyy"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "Month",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "MM"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "Day",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "dd"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "Hour",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "HH"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "availability": {
            "frequency": "Hour",
            "interval": 1
        }
    }
}
```

**Copy activity in a pipeline with Azure Redshift source (RelationalSource) and Blob sink:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **RelationalSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **query** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.

```json
{
    "name": "CopyAmazonRedshiftToBlob",
    "properties": {
        "description": "pipeline for copy activity",
        "activities": [
            {
                "type": "Copy",
                "typeProperties": {
                    "source": {
                        "type": "RelationalSource",
                        "query": "$$Text.Format('select * from MyTable where timestamp >= \\'{0:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss}\\' AND timestamp < \\'{1:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss}\\'', WindowStart, WindowEnd)"
                    },
                    "sink": {
                        "type": "BlobSink",
                        "writeBatchSize": 0,
                        "writeBatchTimeout": "00:00:00"
                    }
                },
                "inputs": [
                    {
                        "name": "AmazonRedshiftInputDataset"
                    }
                ],
                "outputs": [
                    {
                        "name": "AzureBlobOutputDataSet"
                    }
                ],
                "policy": {
                    "timeout": "01:00:00",
                    "concurrency": 1
                },
                "scheduler": {
                    "frequency": "Hour",
                    "interval": 1
                },
                "name": "AmazonRedshiftToBlob"
            }
        ],
        "start": "2014-06-01T18:00:00Z",
        "end": "2014-06-01T19:00:00Z"
    }
}
```
### <a name="type-mapping-for-amazon-redshift"></a>Type mapping for Amazon Redshift
As mentioned in the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following two-step approach:

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

When moving data to Amazon Redshift, the following mappings will be used from Amazon Redshift types to .NET types.

| Amazon Redshift Type | .NET Based Type |
| --- | --- |
| SMALLINT |Int16 |
| INTEGER |Int32 |
| BIGINT |Int64 |
| DECIMAL |Decimal |
| REAL |Single |
| DOUBLE PRECISION |Double |
| BOOLEAN |String |
| CHAR |String |
| VARCHAR |String |
| DATE |DateTime |
| TIMESTAMP |DateTime |
| TEXT |String |

## <a name="map-source-to-sink-columns"></a>Map source to sink columns
To learn about mapping columns in source dataset to columns in sink dataset, see [Mapping dataset columns in Azure Data Factory](data-factory-map-columns.md).

## <a name="repeatable-read-from-relational-sources"></a>Repeatable read from relational sources
When copying data from relational data stores, keep repeatability in mind to avoid unintended outcomes. In Azure Data Factory, you can rerun a slice manually. You can also configure retry policy for a dataset so that a slice is rerun when a failure occurs. When a slice is rerun in either way, you need to make sure that the same data is read no matter how many times a slice is run. See [Repeatable read from relational sources](data-factory-repeatable-copy.md#repeatable-read-from-relational-sources)

## <a name="performance-and-tuning"></a>Performance and Tuning
See [Copy Activity Performance & Tuning Guide](data-factory-copy-activity-performance.md) to learn about key factors that impact performance of data movement (Copy Activity) in Azure Data Factory and various ways to optimize it.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next Steps
See the following articles:

* [Copy Activity tutorial](data-factory-copy-data-from-azure-blob-storage-to-sql-database.md) for step-by-step instructions for creating a pipeline with a Copy Activity.
