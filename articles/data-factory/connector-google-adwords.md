# <a name="copy-data-from-google-adwords-using-azure-data-factory-preview"></a>Copy data from Google AdWords using Azure Data Factory (Preview)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Google AdWords. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and provide feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## <a name="supported-capabilities"></a>Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Google AdWords to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Google AdWords connector.

## <a name="linked-service-properties"></a>Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Google AdWords linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **GoogleAdWords** | Yes |
| clientCustomerID | The Client customer ID of the AdWords account that you want to fetch report data for.  | Yes |
| developerToken | The developer token associated with the manager account that you use to grant access to the AdWords API.  You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in ADF, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let ADF copy acitivty pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| authenticationType | The OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism used for authentication. ServiceAuthentication can only be used on self-hosted IR. <br/>Allowed values are: **ServiceAuthentication**, **UserAuthentication** | Yes |
| refreshToken | The refresh token obtained from Google for authorizing access to AdWords for UserAuthentication. You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in ADF, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let ADF copy acitivty pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| clientId | The client id of the google application used to acquire the refresh token. You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in ADF, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let ADF copy acitivty pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| clientSecret | The client secret of the google application used to acquire the refresh token. You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in ADF, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let ADF copy acitivty pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| email | The service account email ID that is used for ServiceAuthentication and can only be used on self-hosted IR.  | No |
| keyFilePath | The full path to the .p12 key file that is used to authenticate the service account email address and can only be used on self-hosted IR.  | No |
| trustedCertPath | The full path of the .pem file containing trusted CA certificates for verifying the server when connecting over SSL. This property can only be set when using SSL on self-hosted IR. The default value is the cacerts.pem file installed with the IR.  | No |
| useSystemTrustStore | Specifies whether to use a CA certificate from the system trust store or from a specified PEM file. The default value is false.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "GoogleAdWordsLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "GoogleAdWords",
        "typeProperties": {
            "clientCustomerID" : "<clientCustomerID>",
            "developerToken": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<developerToken>"
            },
            "authenticationType" : "ServiceAuthentication",
            "refreshToken": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<refreshToken>"
            },

            },
            "email" : "<email>",
            "keyFilePath" : "<keyFilePath>",
            "trustedCertPath" : "<trustedCertPath>",
            "useSystemTrustStore" : true,
        }
    }
