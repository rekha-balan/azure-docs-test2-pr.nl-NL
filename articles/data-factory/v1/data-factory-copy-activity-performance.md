> [!TIP]
> You can achieve higher throughput by leveraging more data movement units (DMUs) than the default maximum DMUs, which is 32 for a cloud-to-cloud copy activity run. For example, with 100 DMUs, you can achieve copying data from Azure Blob into Azure Data Lake Store at **1.0GBps**. See the [Cloud data movement units](#cloud-data-movement-units) section for details about this feature and the supported scenario. Contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/) to request more DMUs.
