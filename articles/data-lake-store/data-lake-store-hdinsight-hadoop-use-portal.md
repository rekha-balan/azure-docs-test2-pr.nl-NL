This article discusses how to use the Azure portal to create HDInsight clusters with access to Azure Data Lake Store. For supported cluster types, you can use Data Lake Store as default storage or as an additional storage account.

When you use Data Lake Store as additional storage, the default storage account for the clusters remains Azure Blob storage, and the cluster-related files (such as logs) are still written to the default storage. However, the data that you want to process can be stored in a Data Lake Store account. Using Data Lake Store as an additional storage account does not affect performance or the ability to read or write to storage from the cluster.

Here are some important considerations for using HDInsight with Data Lake Store:

* The option to create HDInsight clusters with access to Data Lake Store as default storage is available for HDInsight version 3.5.

* The option to create HDInsight clusters with access to Data Lake Store as default storage is *not available* for HDInsight Premium clusters.

* The option to create HDInsight clusters with access to Data Lake Store as additional storage is available for HDInsight versions 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5.

* For HBase clusters (Windows and Linux), Data Lake Store is *not supported* as a storage option for either default or additional storage.

* For Storm clusters (Windows and Linux), you can use Data Lake Store to write data from a Storm topology. You can also use Data Lake Store for reference data that can then be read by a Storm topology. For more information, see [Use Data Lake Store in a Storm topology](#use-data-lake-store-in-a-storm-topology).


## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, ensure that you've met the following requirements:

* **An Azure subscription**. Go to [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

* **An Azure Data Lake Store account**. Follow the instructions at [Get started with Azure Data Lake Store by using the Azure portal](data-lake-store-get-started-portal.md).

* **An Azure Active Directory service principal**. This tutorial provides instructions on how to create a service principal in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). However, to create a service principal, you must be an Azure AD administrator. If you are an administrator, you can skip this prerequisite and proceed with the tutorial.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can create a service principal only if you are an Azure AD administrator. Your Azure AD administrator must create a service principal before you can create an HDInsight cluster with Data Lake Store. Also, the service principal must be created with a certificate, as described at [Create a service principal with certificate](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal.md#create-service-principal-with-certificate-from-certificate-authority).

## <a name="create-an-hdinsight-cluster-with-access-to-a-data-lake-store"></a>Create an HDInsight cluster with access to a Data Lake Store
In this section, you create an HDInsight Hadoop cluster that uses the Data Lake Store as default storage or additional storage.

### <a name="create-a-cluster-with-data-lake-store-as-default-storage"></a>Create a cluster with Data Lake Store as default storage

>[!NOTE]
>You can use this option only with HDInsight 3.5 clusters (Standard edition). Within HDInsight 3.5 clusters, this option is not available for the HBase cluster type.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. To start provisioning an HDInsight cluster, follow the instructions in [Create Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md).

3. On the **Storage** blade, under **Primary storage type**, click **Data Lake Store**.

4. Select an existing Data Lake Store account and enter a root folder path where the cluster-specific files are to be stored.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.1.adls.storage.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")


    In the screenshot above, the root folder path is /clusters/myhdiadlcluster, where *myhdiadlcluster* is the name of the cluster being created. In such a case, make sure that the */clusters* folder exists in the Data Lake Store account. The *myhdiadlcluster* folder is created during cluster creation. Similarly, if the root path was set to */hdinsight/clusters/data/myhdiadlcluster*, ensure that */hdinsight/clusters/data/* exists in the Data Lake Store account.

5. Click **Data Lake Store access** to configure access between the Data Lake Store account and HDInsight cluster. For instructions see [Configure access between HDInsight cluster and Data Lake Store](#configure-access-between-hdinsight-cluster-and-data-lake-store).


### <a name="create-a-cluster-with-data-lake-store-as-additional-storage"></a>Create a cluster with Data Lake Store as additional storage

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. To start provisioning an HDInsight cluster, follow the instructions in [Create Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md).

3. On the **Storage** blade, under **Primary storage type**, select **Azure Storage**.

4. Under **Selection method**, do either of the following:

    * To specify a storage account that is part of your Azure subscription, select **My subscriptions**, and then select the storage account.

    * To specify a storage account that is outside your Azure subscription, select **Access key**, and then provide the information for the outside storage account.

5. Under **Default container**, retain the default container name that's suggested by the portal or specify your own.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.1.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")

6. When you use Blob storage as default storage, you can still use Data Lake Store as additional storage for the cluster. To do so, click **Data Lake Store access** to configure access between the Data Lake Store account and HDInsight cluster. For instructions see [Configure access between HDInsight cluster and Data Lake Store](#configure-access-between-hdinsight-cluster-and-data-lake-store).

## <a name="configure-access-between-hdinsight-cluster-and-data-lake-store"></a>Configure access between HDInsight cluster and Data Lake Store

In this section, you configure access between HDInsight clusters and Data Lake Store using an Azure Active Directory service principal

1. On the **Data Lake Store access** blade, specify whether you want to use a new service principal or an existing service principal. This step creates a new service principal. To use an existing service principal, skip to the next step.

    a. On the **Data Lake Store access** blade, click **Create new**, and then click **Service Principal**.

    b. On the **Create a Service Principal** blade, enter the required values.  

    c. Click **Create**. A certificate and an Azure AD application are created automatically.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.2.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")

    You can also click **Download Certificate** to download the certificate associated with the service principal you created. Downloading the certificate is useful if you want to use the same service principal when you create additional HDInsight clusters. Click **Select**.

2. To use an existing service principal, perform the steps provided below.

    a. On the **Data Lake Store access** blade, click **Use existing**, and then click **Service Principal**.

    b. On the **Select a Service Principal** blade, search for an existing service principal. Click the service principal that you want to use, and then click **Select**.

    c. On the **Data Lake Store access** blade, upload the certificate (.pfx file) that's associated with your selected service principal, and then enter the certificate password.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.5.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")

7. On the **Data Lake Store access** blade, click **Access**. The **Select file permissions** blade is open by default. It lists all the Data Lake Store accounts in your subscription.

8. Select the Data Lake Store account that you want to associate with the cluster.

    **If you are using Data Lake Store as the default storage**, you should assign permissions at two levels.

    a. First, you should assign permission at the root level of the Data Lake Store account. To do so, hover (do not click) the mouse over the name of the Data Lake Store account to make the check box visible. Select the check box.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.3.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")

    b. Then, you should assign permission to the HDInsight cluster storage root. According to the screenshot earlier, the cluster storage root is **/clusters** folder that you specificed while selecting the Data Lake Store as default storage.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.3.add.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")

    **If you are using Data Lake Store as additional storage**, you must assign permission only for the folder that you want to access from the HDInsight cluster. For example, in the screenshot below, you provide access only to **hdiaddonstorage** folder in a Data Lake Store account.

    ![Assign service principal permissions to the HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.3-1.png "Assign service principal permissions to the HDInsight cluster")

9. For all the accounts and paths you selected, select the permissions (Read, Write, or Execute) and specify whether the permissions apply recursively to the child items as well, and then click **Select**.

11. In the **Assign selected permissions** window, to assign the permissions for the Azure Active Directory service principal on the account, files, or folders you selected, click **Run**.

    ![Assign service principal permissions to the HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.3-2.png "Assign service principal permissions to the HDInsight cluster")

12. After the permissions are successfully assigned, click **Done** on each open blade to return to the **Data Lake Store access** blade.

13. On the **Data Lake Store access**, click **Select**, and then continue with cluster creation as described in [Create Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md).

## <a name="verify-cluster-set-up"></a>Verify cluster set up

After the cluster setup is complete, on the cluster blade, verify your results by doing either or both of the following:

* To verify that the associated storage for the cluster is the Data Lake Store account that you specified, click **Storage accounts** in the left pane.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.6-1.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")

* To verify that the service principal is correctly associated with the HDInsight cluster, click **Data Lake Store access** in the left pane.

    ![Add service principal to HDInsight cluster](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/data-lake-store/media/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal/hdi.adl.6.png "Add service principal to HDInsight cluster")


## <a name="examples"></a>Examples

After you have set up the cluster with Data Lake Store as your storage, refer to these examples of how to use HDInsight cluster to analyze the data that's stored in Data Lake Store.

### <a name="run-a-hive-query-against-data-in-a-data-lake-store-as-primary-storage"></a>Run a Hive query against data in a Data Lake Store (as primary storage)

To run a Hive query, use the Hive views interface in the Ambari portal. For instructions on how to use Ambari Hive views, see [Use the Hive View with Hadoop in HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-use-hive-ambari-view.md).

When you work with data in a Data Lake Store, there are a few strings to change.

If you use, for example, the cluster that you created with Data Lake Store as primary storage, the path to the data is: *adl://<data_lake_store_account_name>/azuredatalakestore.net/path/to/file*. A Hive query to create a table from sample data that's stored in the Data Lake Store account looks like this:

    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE websitelog (str string) LOCATION 'adl://hdiadlsstorage.azuredatalakestore.net/clusters/myhdiadlcluster/HdiSamples/HdiSamples/WebsiteLogSampleData/SampleLog/'

Descriptions:
* `adl://hdiadlstorage.azuredatalakestore.net/` is the root of the Data Lake Store account.
* `/clusters/myhdiadlcluster` is the root of the cluster data that you specified while creating the cluster.
* `/HdiSamples/HdiSamples/WebsiteLogSampleData/SampleLog/` is the location of the sample file that you used in the query.

### <a name="run-a-hive-query-against-data-in-a-data-lake-store-as-additional-storage"></a>Run a Hive query against data in a Data Lake Store (as additional storage)

If the cluster that you created uses Blob storage as default storage, the sample data is not contained in the Azure Data Lake Store account that's used as additional storage. In such a case, first transfer the data from Blob storage to the Data Lake Store, and then run the queries as shown in the preceding example.

For information on how to copy data from Blob storage to a Data Lake Store, see the following articles:

* [Use Distcp to copy data between Azure Storage blobs and Data Lake Store](data-lake-store-copy-data-wasb-distcp.md)
* [Use AdlCopy to copy data from Azure Storage blobs to Data Lake Store](data-lake-store-copy-data-azure-storage-blob.md)

### <a name="use-data-lake-store-with-a-spark-cluster"></a>Use Data Lake Store with a Spark cluster
You can use a Spark cluster to run Spark jobs on data that is stored in a Data Lake Store. For more information, see [Use HDInsight Spark cluster to analyze data in Data Lake Store](../hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-use-with-data-lake-store.md).


### <a name="use-data-lake-store-in-a-storm-topology"></a>Use Data Lake Store in a Storm topology
You can use the Data Lake Store to write data from a Storm topology. For instructions on how to achieve this scenario, see [Use Azure Data Lake Store with Apache Storm with HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-storm-write-data-lake-store.md).
