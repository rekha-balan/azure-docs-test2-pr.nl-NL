# <a name="create-a-web-app-with-continuous-deployment-from-github"></a>Create a web app with continuous deployment from GitHub

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then sets up continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. For GitHub deployment without continuous deployment, see [Create a web app and deploy code from GitHub](app-service-cli-deploy-github.md). In this sample, you will need:

* A GitHub repository with application code, that you have administrative permissions for.
* A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use) for your GitHub account.
