# <a name="create-a-web-app-with-continuous-deployment-from-visual-studio-team-services"></a>Create a web app with continuous deployment from Visual Studio Team Services

* A Visual Studio Team Services repository with application code, that you have administrative permissions for.
* A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/setup-admin/team-services/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate) for your Visual Studio Team Services account.
