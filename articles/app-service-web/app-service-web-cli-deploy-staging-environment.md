# <a name="deploy-a-web-app-to-a-staging-environment"></a>Deploy a web app to a staging environment

This sample script does the following using Azure CLI 2.0: 

* Create a web app in Azure App Service in the West Europe Azure region.
* Upgrade the App Service plan to STANDARD tier (minimum for deployment slots).
* Set up a deployment slot named "staging".
* Deploy your web app code from GitHub to the staging slot.
* Open the deployed staging slot in the browser for verification.
* Swap the staging slot into production.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

* Run `az login` to log in to Azure.
* Put your web app code in a GitHub repository you own.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a public GitHub repository you don't own, App Service will deploy code from that GitHub repository, but cannot set up the SSH key and webhooks necessary for continuous deployment.
