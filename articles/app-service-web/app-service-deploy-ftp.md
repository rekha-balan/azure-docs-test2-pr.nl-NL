# <a name="deploy-your-app-to-azure-app-service-using-ftps"></a>Deploy your app to Azure App Service using FTP/S
This article shows you how to use FTP or FTPS to deploy your web app, mobile app backend, or API app to [Azure App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529714).

The FTP/S endpoint for your app is already active. No configuration is necessary to enable FTP/S deployment. 

<a name="step1"></a>
## <a name="step-1-set-deployment-credentials"></a>Step 1: Set deployment credentials

To access the FTP server for your app, you first need deployment credentials. 

To set or reset your deployment credentials, see [Azure App Service Deployment Credentials](app-service-deployment-credentials.md). This tutorial demonstrates the use of user-level credentials.

## <a name="step-2-get-ftp-connection-information"></a>Step 2: Get FTP connection information

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your app's [resource blade](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md#manage-resources).
2. Select **Overview** in the left menu, then note the values for **FTP/Deployment User**, **FTP Host Name**, and **FTPS Host Name**. 

    ![FTP Connection Information](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/app-service-web/media/web-sites-deploy/FTP-Connection-Info.PNG)

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **FTP/Deployment User** user value as displayed by the Azure Portal including the app name in order to provide proper context for the FTP server.
    > You can find the same information when you select **Properties** in the left menu. 
    >
    > Also, the deployment password is never shown. If you forget your deployment password, go back to [step 1](#step1) and reset your deployment password.
    >
    >

## <a name="step-3-deploy-files-to-azure"></a>Step 3: Deploy files to Azure

1. From your FTP client ([Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/), [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client), etc), use the connection information you gathered to connect to your app.
3. Copy your files and their respective directory structure to the [**/site/wwwroot** directory](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/File-structure-on-azure) in Azure (or the **/site/wwwroot/App_Data/Jobs/** directory for WebJobs).
4. Browse to your app's URL to verify the app is running properly. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Unlike [Git-based deployments](app-service-deploy-local-git.md), FTP deployment doesn't support the following deployment automations: 
>
> - dependency restore (such as NuGet, NPM, PIP, and Composer automations)
> - compilation of .NET binaries
> - generation of web.config (here is a [Node.js example](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Using-a-custom-web.config-for-Node-apps))
> 
> You must restore, build, and generate these necessary files manually on your local machine and deploy them together with your app.

For more advanced deployment scenarios, try [deploying to Azure with Git](app-service-deploy-local-git.md). Git-based deployment to Azure enables version control, package restore, MSBuild, and more.
