# <a name="built-in-roles-for-azure-role-based-access-control"></a>Built-in roles for Azure Role-Based Access Control
Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) comes with the following built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services. You canâ€™t modify the definitions of built-in roles. However, you can create [Custom roles in Azure RBAC](role-based-access-control-custom-roles.md) to fit the specific needs of your organization.

## <a name="roles-in-azure"></a>Roles in Azure
The following table provides brief descriptions of the built-in roles. Click the role name to see the detailed list of **actions** and **notactions** for the role. The **actions** property specifies the allowed actions on Azure resources. Action strings can use wildcard characters. The **notactions** property specifies the actions that are excluded from the allowed actions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure role definitions are constantly evolving. This article is kept as up to date as possible, but you can always find the latest roles definitions in Azure PowerShell. Use the cmdlets `(get-azurermroledefinition "<role name>").actions` or `(get-azurermroledefinition "<role name>").notactions` as applicable.
