# <a name="how-to-get-appsource-certified-for-azure-active-directory-ad"></a>How to get AppSource Certified for Azure Active Directory (AD)
To receive AppSource certification for Azure AD, your application must implement the multi-tenant sign in pattern with Azure AD using the OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 protocols.  

If you’re not familiar with Azure AD sign-in or multi-tenant application development:

1. Start by reading about the [Browser to Web App scenarios in Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD][AAD-Auth-Scenarios-Browser-To-WebApp].  
2. Next, check out the Azure AD [web application quick-start guides][AAD-QuickStart-Web-Apps], which demonstrate how to implement sign-in, and include companion code samples. 
   
   > [!TIP]
   > Try the preview of our new [developer portal](https://identity.microsoft.com/Docs/Web) that will help you get up and running with Azure Active Directory in just a few minutes!  The developer portal will walk you through the process of registering an app and integrating Azure AD into your code.  When you’re finished, you will have a simple application that can authenticate users in your tenant and a back-end that can accept tokens and perform validation.

3. To learn how to implement the multi-tenant sign-in pattern with Azure AD, check out [How to sign in any Azure Active Directory (AD) user using the multi-tenant application pattern][AAD-Howto-Multitenant-Overview]
