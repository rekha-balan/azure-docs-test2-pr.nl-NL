# <a name="get-started-with-web-apis-for-nodejs"></a>Get started with web APIs for Node.js
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-devguide](../../../includes/active-directory-devguide.md)]

*Passport* is authentication middleware for Node.js. Flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based or Restify web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication with a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more. We have developed a strategy for Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). We install this module and then add the Microsoft Azure Active Directory `passport-azure-ad` plug-in.

To do this, you need to:

1. Register an application with Azure AD.
2. Set up your app to use Passport's `passport-azure-ad` plug-in.
3. Configure a client application to call the To Do List web API.

The code for this tutorial is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-node-webapi).

> [!NOTE]
> This article doesn't cover how to implement sign-in, sign-up, or profile management with Azure AD B2C. It focuses on calling web APIs after the user is already authenticated.  We recommend that you start with [How to integrate with Azure Active Directory document](active-directory-how-to-integrate.md) to learn about the basics of Azure Active Directory.

We've released all the source code for this running example in GitHub under an MIT license, so feel free to clone (or even better, fork), and provide feedback and pull requests.

## <a name="about-nodejs-modules"></a>About Node.js modules
We use Node.js modules in this walkthrough. Modules are loadable JavaScript packages that provide specific functionality for your application. You usually install modules by using the Node.js an NPM command-line tool in the NPM installation directory. However, some modules, such as the HTTP module, are included in the core Node.js package.

Installed modules are saved in the **node_modules** directory at the root of your Node.js installation directory. Each module in the **node_modules** directory maintains its own **node_modules** directory that contains any modules that it depends on. Also, each required module has a **node_modules** directory. This recursive directory structure represents the dependency chain.

This dependency chain structure results in a larger application footprint. But it also guarantees that all dependencies are met and that the version of the modules that's used in development is also used in production. This makes the production app behavior more predictable and prevents versioning problems that might affect users.

## <a name="step-1-register-an-azure-ad-tenant"></a>Step 1: Register an Azure AD tenant
To use this sample, you need an Azure Active Directory tenant. If you're not sure what a tenant is or how to get one, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](active-directory-howto-tenant.md).

## <a name="step-2-create-an-application"></a>Step 2: Create an application
Next you create an app in your directory that gives Azure AD information that it needs to securely communicate with your app.  Both the client app and web API are represented by a single **Application ID** in this case, because they comprise one logical app.  To create an app, follow [these instructions](active-directory-how-applications-are-added.md). If you are building a line-of-business app, [these additional instructions might be useful](../active-directory-applications-guiding-developers-for-lob-applications.md).

To create an application:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the top menu, select your account. Then, under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you want to register your application.

3. In the menu on the left, select **More Services**, and then select **Azure Active Directory**.

4. Select **App registrations**, and then select **Add**.

5. Follow the prompts to create a **Web Application and/or WebAPI**.

      * The **name** of the application describes your application to end users.

      * The **Sign-On URL** is the base URL of your app.  The default URL of the sample code is `https://localhost:8080`.

6. After you register, Azure AD assigns your app a unique Application ID. You need this value in the next sections, so copy it from the application page.

7. From the **Settings** -> **Properties** page for your application, update the App ID URI. The **App ID URI** is a unique identifier for your application. The convention is to use `https://<tenant-domain>/<app-name>`, for example: `https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/my-first-aad-app`.

8. Create a **Key** for your application from the **Settings** page, and then copy it somewhere. You'll need it shortly.

## <a name="step-3-download-nodejs-for-your-platform"></a>Step 3: Download Node.js for your platform
To successfully use this sample, you must have a working installation of Node.js.

Install Node.js from [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

## <a name="step-4-install-mongodb-on-your-platform"></a>Step 4: Install MongoDB on your platform
To successfully use this sample, you must have a working installation of MongoDB. You use MongoDB to make the REST API persistent across server instances.

Install MongoDB from [http://mongodb.org](http://www.mongodb.org).

> [!NOTE]
> This walkthrough assumes that you use the default installation and server endpoints for MongoDB, which at the time of this writing is mongodb://localhost.
>

## <a name="step-5-install-the-restify-modules-in-your-web-api"></a>Step 5: Install the Restify modules in your web API
We are using Restify to build our REST API. Restify is a minimal and flexible Node.js application framework that's derived from Express. It has a robust set of features for building REST APIs on top of Connect.

### <a name="install-restify"></a>Install Restify
1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** directory. If the **azuread** directory does not exist, create it.

        `cd azuread - or- mkdir azuread; cd azuread`

2. Type the following command:

    `npm install restify`

    This command installs Restify.

#### <a name="did-you-get-an-error"></a>Did you get an error?
When you use NPM on some operating systems, you might receive an error that says **Error: EPERM, chmod '/usr/local/bin/..'** and a suggestion that you try running the account as an administrator. If this occurs, use the sudo command to run NPM at a higher privilege level.

#### <a name="did-you-get-an-error-regarding-dtrace"></a>Did you get an error regarding DTRACE?
You might see an error like this when installing Restify:

```Shell
clang: error: no such file or directory: 'HD/azuread/node_modules/restify/node_modules/dtrace-provider/libusdt'
make: *** [Release/DTraceProviderBindings.node] Error 1
gyp ERR! build error

gyp ERR! node -v v0.10.11
gyp ERR! node-gyp -v v0.10.0
gyp ERR! not ok
npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing dtrace-provider@0.2.8
```
Restify provides a powerful mechanism for tracing REST calls by using DTrace. However, many operating systems do not have DTrace. You can safely ignore these errors.

The output of this command should look similar to the following output:

    └── bunyan@0.22.0 (mv@0.0.5)


## <a name="step-6-install-passportjs-in-your-web-api"></a>Step 6: Install Passport.js in your web API
[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) is authentication middleware for Node.js. Flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based or Restify web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication with a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

We have developed a strategy for Azure Active Directory. We install this module and then add the Azure Active Directory strategy plug-in.

1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** directory.

2. To install passport.js, enter the following command :

    `npm install passport`

    The output of the command should look similar to the following:

``
        passport@0.1.17 node_modules\passport
        ├── pause@0.0.1
        └── pkginfo@0.2.3
``

## <a name="step-7-add-passport-azure-ad-to-your-web-api"></a>Step 7: Add Passport-Azure-AD to your web API
Next we add the OAuth strategy by using `passport-azure-ad`, a suite of strategies that connect Azure Active Directory to Passport. We use this strategy for bearer tokens in this REST API sample.

> [!NOTE]
> Although OAuth2 provides a framework in which any known token type can be issued, only certain token types are commonly used. Bearer tokens are the most commonly used tokens for protecting endpoints. They are the most widely issued type of token in OAuth2. Many implementations assume that bearer tokens are the only type of tokens that are issued.
>
>

From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** directory.

Type the following command to install the Passport.js `passport-azure-ad module`:

`npm install passport-azure-ad`

The output of the command should look similar to the following output:


    passport-azure-ad@1.0.0 node_modules/passport-azure-ad
    ├── xtend@4.0.0
    ├── xmldom@0.1.19
    ├── passport-http-bearer@1.0.1 (passport-strategy@1.0.0)

    ├── async@1.3.0
    ├── jsonwebtoken@5.0.2
    ├── xml-crypto@0.5.27 (xpath.js@1.0.6)
    ├── ursa@0.8.5 (bindings@1.2.1, nan@1.8.4)
    ├── jws@3.0.0 (jwa@1.0.1, base64url@1.0.4)

    └── xml2js@0.4.9 (sax@0.6.1, xmlbuilder@2.6.4)



## <a name="step-8-add-mongodb-modules-to-your-web-api"></a>Step 8: Add MongoDB modules to your web API
We use MongoDB as our datastore. For that reason, we need to install the widely used plug-in called Mongoose to manage models and schemas. We also need to install the database driver for MongoDB (which is also called MongoDB).

 `npm install mongoose`

## <a name="step-9-install-additional-modules"></a>Step 9: Install additional modules
Next we install the remaining required modules.

1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if you're not already there.

    `cd azuread`

2. Enter the following commands to install these modules in your **node_modules** directory:

    * `npm install assert-plus`
    * `npm install bunyan`
    * `npm update`

## <a name="step-10-create-a-serverjs-with-your-dependencies"></a>Step 10: Create a server.js with your dependencies
The server.js file provides most of the functionality for our web API server. We add most of our code to this file. For production purposes, we recommend that you refactor the functionality into smaller files, such as separate routes and controllers. In this demo, we use server.js for this functionality.

1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if you're not already there.

    `cd azuread`

2. Create a `server.js` file in your favorite editor, and then add the following information:

    ```Javascript
        'use strict';

        /**
         * Module dependencies.
         */

        var fs = require('fs');
        var path = require('path');
        var util = require('util');
        var assert = require('assert-plus');
        var bunyan = require('bunyan');
        var getopt = require('posix-getopt');
        var mongoose = require('mongoose/');
        var restify = require('restify');
        var passport = require('passport');
      var BearerStrategy = require('passport-azure-ad').BearerStrategy;
    ```

3. Save the file. We'll return to it shortly.

## <a name="step-11-create-a-config-file-to-store-your-azure-ad-settings"></a>Step 11: Create a config file to store your Azure AD settings
This code file passes the configuration parameters from your Azure Active Directory portal to Passport.js. You created these configuration values when you added the web API to the portal in the first part of the walkthrough. We explain what to put in the values of these parameters after you copy the code.

1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if you're not already there.

    `cd azuread`

2. Create a `config.js` file in your favorite editor, and then add the following information:

    ```Javascript
         exports.creds = {
             mongoose_auth_local: 'mongodb://localhost/tasklist', // Your mongo auth uri goes here
             clientID: 'your client ID',
             audience: 'your application URL',
            // you cannot have users from multiple tenants sign in to your server unless you use the common endpoint
          // example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration
             identityMetadata: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your tenant id>/.well-known/openid-configuration',
             validateIssuer: true, // if you have validation on, you cannot have users from multiple tenants sign in to your server
             passReqToCallback: false,
             loggingLevel: 'info' // valid are 'info', 'warn', 'error'. Error always goes to stderr in Unix.

         };
    ```
3. Save the file.

## <a name="step-12-add-configuration-values-to-your-serverjs-file"></a>Step 12: Add configuration values to your server.js file
We need to read these values from the .config file that you created across our application. To do this, we add the .config file as a required resource in our application. Then we set the global variables to match the variables in the config.js document.

1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if you're not already there.

    `cd azuread`

2. Open your `server.js` file in your favorite editor, and then add the following information:

    ```Javascript
    var config = require('./config');
    ```
3. Then add a new section to `server.js` with the following code:

    ```Javascript
    var options = {
        // The URL of the metadata document for your app. We will put the keys for token validation from the URL found in the jwks_uri tag of the in the metadata.
        identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,
        clientID: config.creds.clientID,
        validateIssuer: config.creds.validateIssuer,
        audience: config.creds.audience,
        passReqToCallback: config.creds.passReqToCallback,
        loggingLevel: config.creds.loggingLevel

    };

    // Array to hold logged in users and the current logged in user (owner).
    var users = [];
    var owner = null;

    // Our logger.
    var log = bunyan.createLogger({
        name: 'Azure Active Directory Bearer Sample',
             streams: [
            {
                stream: process.stderr,
                level: "error",
                name: "error"
            },
            {
                stream: process.stdout,
                level: "warn",
                name: "console"
            }, ]
    });

      // If the logging level is specified, switch to it.
      if (config.creds.loggingLevel) { log.levels("console", config.creds.loggingLevel); }

    // MongoDB setup.
    // Set up some configuration.
    var serverPort = process.env.PORT || 8080;
    var serverURI = (process.env.PORT) ? config.creds.mongoose_auth_mongohq : config.creds.mongoose_auth_local;
    ```

4. Save the file.

## <a name="step-13-add-the-mongodb-model-and-schema-information-by-using-mongoose"></a>Step 13: Add The MongoDB Model and schema information by using Mongoose
Now all this preparation is going to start paying off as we combine these three files into a REST API service.

For this walkthrough, we use MongoDB to store our tasks as discussed in Step 4.

In the `config.js` file that we created in Step 11, we called our database `tasklist`, because that was what we put at the end of our **mogoose_auth_local** connection URL. You don't need to create this database beforehand in MongoDB. Instead, MongoDB creates this for us on the first run of our server application (assuming that the database doesn't already exist).

Now that we've told the server which MongoDB database we'd like to use, we need to write some additional code to create the model and schema for our server's tasks.

### <a name="discussion-of-the-model"></a>Discussion of the model
Our schema model is simple. You expand it as required.

NAME: The name of the person who is assigned to the task. A **String**.

TASK: The task itself. A **String**.

DATE: The date that the task is due. A **DATETIME**.

COMPLETED: If the task has been completed or not. A **BOOLEAN**.

### <a name="creating-the-schema-in-the-code"></a>Creating the schema in the code
1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if you're not already there.

    `cd azuread`

2. Open your `server.js` file in your favorite editor, and then add the following information below the configuration entry:

    ```Javascript
    // Connect to MongoDB.
    global.db = mongoose.connect(serverURI);
    var Schema = mongoose.Schema;
    log.info('MongoDB Schema loaded');

    // Here we create a schema to store our tasks and users. It's a fairly simple schema for now.
    var TaskSchema = new Schema({
        owner: String,
        task: String,
        completed: Boolean,
        date: Date
    });

    // Use the schema to register a model.
    mongoose.model('Task', TaskSchema);
    var Task = mongoose.model('Task');
    ```
As you can tell from the code, we create our schema first. Then we create a model object that we use to store our data throughout the code when we define our **Routes**.

## <a name="step-14-add-our-routes-for-our-task-rest-api-server"></a>Step 14: Add our routes for our task REST API server
Now that we have a database model to work with, let's add the routes we are going use for our REST API server.

### <a name="about-routes-in-restify"></a>About routes in Restify
Routes work in Restify the same way they do in the Express stack. You define routes by using the URI that you expect the client applications to call. Usually, you define your routes in a separate file. For our purposes, we put our routes in the server.js file. We recommend that you factor these routes into their own file for production use.

A typical pattern for a Restify route is as follows:

```Javascript
function createObject(req, res, next) {

// Do work on object.

 _object.name = req.params.object; // passed value is in req.params under object

 ///...

return next(); // Keep the server going.
}

....

server.post('/service/:add/:object', createObject); // Calls createObject on routes that match this.

```


This is the pattern at its most basic level. Restify (and Express) provide much deeper functionality, such as defining application types and providing complex routing across different endpoints. For our purposes, we are keeping these routes simple.

### <a name="add-default-routes-to-our-server"></a>Add default routes to our server
We now add the basic CRUD routes of Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete.

1. From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if you're not already there:

    `cd azuread`

2. Open the `server.js` file in your favorite editor, and then add the following information below the previous database entries that you made:

```Javascript

/**
 *
 * APIs for our REST Task server.
 */

// Create a task.

function createTask(req, res, next) {

    // Restify currently has a bug which doesn't allow you to set default headers.
    // These headers comply with CORS and allow us to mongodbServer our response to any origin.

    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Requested-With");

    // Create a new task model, fill it, and save it to Mongodb.
    var _task = new Task();

    if (!req.params.task) {
        req.log.warn('createTodo: missing task');
        next(new MissingTaskError());
        return;
    }

    _task.owner = owner;
    _task.task = req.params.task;
    _task.date = new Date();

    _task.save(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            req.log.warn(err, 'createTask: unable to save');
            next(err);
        } else {
            res.send(201, _task);

        }
    });

    return next();

}


// Delete a task by name.

function removeTask(req, res, next) {

    Task.remove({
        task: req.params.task,
        owner: owner
    }, function(err) {
        if (err) {
            req.log.warn(err,
                'removeTask: unable to delete %s',
                req.params.task);
            next(err);
        } else {
            log.info('Deleted task:', req.params.task);
            res.send(204);
            next();
        }
    });
}

// Delete all tasks.

function removeAll(req, res, next) {
    Task.remove();
    res.send(204);
    return next();
}


// Get a specific task based on name.

function getTask(req, res, next) {

    log.info('getTask was called for: ', owner);
    Task.find({
        owner: owner
    }, function(err, data) {
        if (err) {
            req.log.warn(err, 'get: unable to read %s', owner);
            next(err);
            return;
        }

        res.json(data);
    });

    return next();
}

/// Simple returns the list of TODOs that were loaded.

function listTasks(req, res, next) {
    // Restify currently has a bug which doesn't allow you to set default headers.
    // These headers comply with CORS and allow us to mongodbServer our response to any origin.

    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Requested-With");

    log.info("listTasks was called for: ", owner);

    Task.find({
        owner: owner
    }).limit(20).sort('date').exec(function(err, data) {

        if (err) {
            return next(err);
        }

        if (data.length > 0) {
            log.info(data);
        }

        if (!data.length) {
            log.warn(err, "There is no tasks in the database. Did you initialize the database as stated in the README?");
        }

        if (!owner) {

## <a name="step-15-create-your-server"></a>Step 15: Create your server
We have defined our database and our routes are in place. The last thing to do is add the server instance that manages our calls.

In Restify (and Express) you can do a lot of customization for a REST API server, but again we are going to use the most basic setup for our purposes.

```Javascript
/**
 * Our server.
 */


var server = restify.createServer({
    name: "Azure Active Directroy TODO Server",
    version: "2.0.1"
});

// Ensure we don't drop data on uploads.
server.pre(restify.pre.pause());

// Clean up sloppy paths like //todo//////1//.
server.pre(restify.pre.sanitizePath());

// Handle annoying user agents (curl).
server.pre(restify.pre.userAgentConnection());

// Set a per request bunyan logger (with requestid filled in).
server.use(restify.requestLogger());

// Allow five requests per second by IP, and burst to 10.
server.use(restify.throttle({
    burst: 10,
    rate: 5,
    ip: true,
}));

// Use the common stuff you probably want.
server.use(restify.acceptParser(server.acceptable));
server.use(restify.dateParser());
server.use(restify.queryParser());
server.use(restify.gzipResponse());
server.use(restify.bodyParser({
    mapParams: true
})); // Allow for JSON mapping to REST.
```

## <a name="step-16-add-the-routes-to-the-server-without-authentication-for-now"></a>Step 16: Add the routes to the server (without authentication for now)
```Javascript
/// Now the real handlers. Here we just CRUD.
/**
/*
/* Each of these handlers is protected by our OIDCBearerStrategy by invoking 'oidc-bearer'.
/* In the pasport.authenticate() method. We set 'session: false' because REST is stateless and
/* we don't need to maintain session state. You can experiment with removing API protection
/* by removing the passport.authenticate() method as follows:
/*
/* server.get('/tasks', listTasks);
/*
**/
server.get('/tasks', listTasks);
server.get('/tasks', listTasks);
server.get('/tasks/:owner', getTask);
server.head('/tasks/:owner', getTask);
server.post('/tasks/:owner/:task', createTask);
server.post('/tasks', createTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner/:task', removeTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner', removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', removeAll, function respond(req, res, next) {
res.send(204);
next();
});
// Register a default '/' handler.
server.get('/', function root(req, res, next) {
var routes = [
'GET /',
'POST /tasks/:owner/:task',
'POST /tasks (for JSON body)',
'GET /tasks',
'PUT /tasks/:owner',
'GET /tasks/:owner',
'DELETE /tasks/:owner/:task'
];
res.send(200, routes);
next();
});
server.listen(serverPort, function() {
var consoleMessage = '\n Microsoft Azure Active Directory Tutorial';
consoleMessage += '\n +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++';
consoleMessage += '\n %s server is listening at %s';
consoleMessage += '\n Open your browser to %s/tasks\n';
consoleMessage += '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \n';
consoleMessage += '\n !!! why not try a $curl -isS %s | json to get some ideas? \n';
consoleMessage += '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \n\n';
});
```

## <a name="step-17-run-the-server-before-adding-oauth-support"></a>Step 17: Run the server (before adding OAuth support)
Test out your server before we add authentication.

The easiest way to test your server is by using curl in a command line. Before we do that, we need a utility that allows us to parse output as JSON.

1. Install the following JSON tool (all the following examples use this tool):

    `$npm install -g jsontool`

    This installs the JSON tool globally. Now that we’ve accomplished that, let’s play with the server:

2. First, make sure that your mongoDB instance is running:

    `$sudo mongod`

3. Then, change to the directory and start curling:

    `$ cd azuread` `$ node server.js`

    `$ curl -isS http://127.0.0.1:8080 | json`

    ```Shell
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 171
    Date: Tue, 14 Jul 2015 05:43:38 GMT
    [
    "GET /",
    "POST /tasks/:owner/:task",
    "POST /tasks (for JSON body)",
    "GET /tasks",
    "PUT /tasks/:owner",
    "GET /tasks/:owner",
    "DELETE /tasks/:owner/:task"
    ]
    ```

4. Then, we can add a task this way:

    `$ curl -isS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/tasks/brandon/Hello`

    The response should be:

        ```Shell
        HTTP/1.1 201 Created
        Connection: close
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        Content-Length: 5
        Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2014 01:02:26 GMT
        Hello
        ```
    And we can list tasks for Brandon this way:

        `$ curl -isS http://127.0.0.1:8080/tasks/brandon/`

If all this works, we're ready to add OAuth to the REST API server.

You have a REST API server with MongoDB!

## <a name="step-18-add-authentication-to-our-rest-api-server"></a>Step 18: Add authentication to our REST API server
Now that we have a running REST API, let's start making it useful with Azure AD.

From the command line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if you're not already there.

`cd azuread`

### <a name="use-the-oidcbearerstrategy-that-is-included-with-passport-azure-ad"></a>Use the OIDCBearerStrategy that is included with passport-azure-ad
So far we have built a typical REST TODO server without any kind of authorization. This is where we start putting that together.

1. First, we need to indicate that we want to use Passport. Put this right after your other server configuration:

    ```Javascript
            // Let's start using Passport.js.

            server.use(passport.initialize()); // Starts passport.
            server.use(passport.session()); // Provides session support.
    ```
    > [!TIP]
    > When you write APIs, we recommend that you always link the data to something unique from the token that the user can’t spoof. When this server stores TODO items, it stores them based on the object ID of the user in the token (called through token.oid), which we put in the “owner” field. This ensures that only that user can access their TODOs. There is no exposure in the API of “owner,” so an external user can request the TODOs of others even if they are authenticated.                    

2. Next let’s use the bearer strategy that comes with `passport-azure-ad`. Look at the code for now and we'll explain the rest shortly. Put this after what you pasted above:

```Javascript
    /**
    /*
    /* Calling the OIDCBearerStrategy and managing users.
    /*
    /* Passport pattern provides the need to manage users and info tokens
    /* with a FindorCreate() method that must be provided by the implementor.
    /* Here we just auto-register any user and implement a FindById().
    /* You'll want to do something smarter.
    **/

    var findById = function(id, fn) {
        for (var i = 0, len = users.length; i < len; i++) {
            var user = users[i];
            if (user.sub === id) {
                log.info('Found user: ', user);
                return fn(null, user);
            }
        }
        return fn(null, null);
    };


    var bearerStrategy = new BearerStrategy(options,
        function(token, done) {
            log.info('verifying the user');
            log.info(token, 'was the token retreived');
            findById(token.sub, function(err, user) {
                if (err) {
                    return done(err);
                }
                if (!user) {
                    // "Auto-registration"
                    log.info('User was added automatically as they were new. Their sub is: ', token.sub);
                    users.push(token);
                    owner = token.sub;
                    return done(null, token);
                }
                owner = token.sub;
                return done(null, user, token);
            });
        }
    );

    passport.use(bearerStrategy);
```

Passport uses a similar pattern for all its strategies (Twitter, Facebook, and so on) that all strategy writers adhere to. Looking at the strategy, you see we pass it a function that has a token and a done as the parameters. The strategy comes back to us after it does its work. After it does, we store the user and stash the token so we won’t need to ask for it again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The previous code takes any user that happens to authenticate to our server. This is known as auto-registration. In production servers, you we recommend that you don't let anyone in without first having them go through a registration process that you decide on. This is usually the pattern you see in consumer apps, which allow you to register with Facebook but then ask you to fill out additional information. If this wasn’t a command-line program, we could have extracted the email from the token object that is returned and then asked the user to fill out additional information. Because this is a test server, we simply add them to the in-memory database.

### <a name="protect-some-endpoints"></a>Protect some endpoints
You protect endpoints by specifying the `passport.authenticate()` call with the protocol that you want to use.

To make our server code do something more interesting, let’s edit the route.

```Javascript
server.get('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), listTasks);
server.get('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), listTasks);
server.get('/tasks/:owner', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), getTask);
server.head('/tasks/:owner', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), getTask);
server.post('/tasks/:owner/:task', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), createTask);
server.post('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), createTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner/:task', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeAll, function respond(req, res, next) {
res.send(204);
next();
});
```

## <a name="step-19-run-your-server-application-again-and-ensure-it-rejects-you"></a>Step 19: Run your server application again and ensure it rejects you
Let's use `curl` again to see if we now have OAuth2 protection against our endpoints. We do this test before running any of our client SDKs against this endpoint. The headers that are returned should be enough to tell us if we're going down the right path.

1. First, make sure that your mongoDB instance is running:

    `$sudo mongod`

2. Then, change to the directory and start curling.

      `$ cd azuread` `$ node server.js`

3. Try a basic POST.

    `$ curl -isS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/tasks/brandon/Hello`

    ```Shell
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Connection: close
    WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="Users"
    Date: Tue, 14 Jul 2015 05:45:03 GMT
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    ```

A 401 is the response you are looking for here. This response indicates that the Passport layer is trying to redirect to the authorized endpoint, which is exactly what you want.

## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps
You've gone as far as you can with this server without using an OAuth2 compatible client. You will need to go through an additional walkthrough.

You've now learned how to implement a REST API by using Restify and OAuth2. You also have more than enough code to keep developing your service and learning how to build on this example.

If you are interested in the next steps in your ADAL journey, here are some supported ADAL clients we recommend that you  keep working with.

Clone down to your developer machine and configure as described in the walkthrough.
