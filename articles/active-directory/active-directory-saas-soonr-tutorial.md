# <a name="tutorial-azure-active-directory-integration-with-soonr-workplace"></a>Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Soonr Workplace

The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate Soonr Workplace with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).  
Integrating Soonr Workplace with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Soonr Workplace
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Soonr Workplace (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure classic portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Soonr Workplace, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Soonr Workplace single-sign on enabled subscription


> [!NOTE] 
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.


To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).


## <a name="scenario-description"></a>Scenario description
The objective of this tutorial is to enable you to test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.  
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Soonr Workplace from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on


## <a name="adding-soonr-workplace-from-the-gallery"></a>Adding Soonr Workplace from the gallery
To configure the integration of Soonr Workplace into Azure AD, you need to add Soonr Workplace from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Soonr Workplace from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure classic portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. 

    ![Active Directory][1]

2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.

3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.

    ![Applications][2]

4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.

    ![Applications][3]

5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.
 
    ![Applications][4]

6. In the search box, type **Soonr Workplace**.
 
    ![Creating an Azure AD test user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-saas-soonr-tutorial/tutorial_soonr_01.png)

7. In the results pane, select **Soonr Workplace**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.

##  <a name="configuring-and-testing-azure-ad-single-sign-on"></a>Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
The objective of this section is to show you how to configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Soonr Workplace based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Soonr Workplace to an user in Azure AD is. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Soonr Workplace needs to be established.  

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in Soonr Workplace.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Soonr Workplace, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Soonr Workplace test user](#creating-a-soonr-workplace-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Soonr Workplace that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### <a name="configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on"></a>Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the classic portal and configure single sign-on in your Soonr Workplace application.
