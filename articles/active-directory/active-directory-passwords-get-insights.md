## <a name="overview-of-password-management-reports"></a>Overview of password management reports
Once you deploy password reset, one of the most common next steps is to see how it is being used in your organization.  For example, you may want to get insight into how users are registering for password reset, or how many password resets have been done in the last few days.  Here are some of the common questions that you will be able to answer with the password management reports that exist in the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) today:

* How many people have registered for password reset?
* Who has registered for password reset?
* What data are people registering?
* How many people reset their passwords in the last 7 days?
* What are the most common methods users or admins use to reset their passwords?
* What are common issues users or admins face when attempting to use password reset?
* What admins are resetting their own passwords frequently?
* Is there any suspicious activity going on with password reset?

## <a name="how-to-view-password-management-reports"></a>How to view Password Management Reports
In the new [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) experience, we have an improved way to view password reset and password reset registration activity.  Follow the steps below to find the password reset and password reset registration events in the new [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com):

1. Navigate to [**portal.azure.com**](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click on the **More services** menu on the main Azure Portal left hand navigation
3. Search for **Azure Active Directory** in the list of services and select it
4. Click on **Users & Groups** from the Azure Active Directory navigation menu
5. Click on the **Audit Logs** navigation item from the Users & Groups navigation menu. This will show you all of the audit events occuring against all the users in your directory. You can filter this view to see all the password-related events, as well.
6. To filter this view to only the password management related events, click the **Filter** button at the top of the blade.
7. From the **Filter** menu, select the **Category** dropdown, and change it to the **Self-service Password Management** category type.
8. Optionally further filter the list by choosing the specific **Activity** you are interested
### <a name="direct-link-to-user-audit-blade"></a>Direct link to User Audit blade
If you are signed in to your portal, here is a direct link to the user audit blade where you can see these events:

* [Go to user management audit view directly](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UserManagementMenuBlade/Audit)

### <a name="directory-roles-allowed-to-read-reports"></a>Directory Roles allowed to read reports
Currently, the following directory roles may read Azure AD Password Management reports in the classic Azure portal:

* Global administrator

Before being able to read these reports, a global administrator in the company must have opted-in for this data to be retrieved on behalf of the organization by visiting the reporting tab or audit logs at least once. Until doing so, data will not be collected for your organization.

To read more about directory roles and what they can do, see [Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles).

## <a name="how-to-retrieve-password-management-events-from-the-azure-ad-reports-and-events-api"></a>How to retrieve password management events from the Azure AD Reports and Events API
As of August 2015, the Azure AD Reports and Events API now supports retrieving all of the information included in the password reset and password reset registration reports. By using this API, you can download individual password reset and password reset registration events for integration with the reporting technology of your choce.

### <a name="how-to-get-started-with-the-reporting-api"></a>How to get started with the reporting API
To access this data, you'll need to write a small app or script to retrieve it from our servers. [Learn how to get started with the Azure AD Reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started.md).

Once you have a working script, you'll next want to examine the password reset and registration events that you can retrieve to meet your scenarios.

* [SsprActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset events
* [SsprRegistrationActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprRegistrationActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset registration events

### <a name="reporting-api-data-retrieval-limitations"></a>Reporting API data retrieval limitations
Currently, the Azure AD Reports and Events API retrieves up to **75,000 individual events** of the [SsprActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprActivityEvent) and [SsprRegistrationActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprRegistrationActivityEvent) types, spanning the **last 30 days**.

If you need to retrieve or store data beyond this window, we suggest persisting it in an external database and using the API to query the deltas that result. A best practice is to begin retrieving this data when you start your password reset registration process in your organization, persist it externally, and then continue to track the deltas from this point forward.

## <a name="how-to-download-password-reset-registration-events-quickly-with-powershell"></a>How to download password reset registration events quickly with PowerShell
In addition to using the Azure AD Reports and Events API directly, you may also use the below PowerShell script to recent registration events in your directory. This is useful in case you want to see who has registered recently, or would like to ensure that your password reset rollout is occurring as you expect.
