>[!NOTE] 
>Because new connectors are automatically assigned to a default connector group, for large deployments we recommend that you do not have applications assigned to the default group. Therefore once installed, new connectors will not receive any live traffic. Only after you assign the connector to one of the active groups, it can start serving live traffic. This also enables you to put connectors in an idle mode in order to enable maintenance.
