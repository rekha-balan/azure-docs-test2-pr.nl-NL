> [!NOTE]
> Azure pay as you go subscriptions are different: while also represented in your directory, these subscriptions enable creation of Azure resources and map them to your payment method. In this case, there are NO license counts associated with the subscription. Users' association with the subscription, the users' access to managing subscription resources, is achieved by granting them permissions to operate on Azure resources mapped to the subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure AD Premium and Basic, as well as Enterprise Mobility Suite subscriptions, are confined to their provisioned directory/tenant. Subscriptions cannot be split between directories or used to entitle users in other directories. Moving a subscription between directories is possible but requires submitting a support ticket or cancellation and re-purchase in the case of direct purchases.
>
> When purchasing Azure AD or Enterprise Mobility Suite through Volume Licensing subscription activation will happen automatically when the agreement includes other Microsoft Online services; for example, Office 365.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD supports “external users,” which are user accounts in an instance of Azure AD that were created using either a Microsoft Account (MSA) or an Azure AD identity from another directory. While we are busy extending this capability into all of Microsoft's organizational services, right now these accounts are not supported in some of the services' experiences; for example, the Office 365 administration portal does not currently support these users. Thus, external users with Microsoft accounts will not be able to access the Office 365 administration portal at all, while external users from other Azure AD directories will be ignored. In the latter case, only the user’s local account, the Azure AD or Office 365 directory where the user was originally created, is accessible through these experiences.

> [!NOTE]
> Some Microsoft services are not available in all locations; before a license can be assigned to a user, the administrator must specify the “Usage location” property on the user. This can be done under User &gt; Profile &gt; Settings section in the Azure portal. When using group license assignment, any users without a usage location specified will inherit the location of the directory.
