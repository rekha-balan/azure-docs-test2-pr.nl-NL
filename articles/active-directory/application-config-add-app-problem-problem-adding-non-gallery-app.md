# <a name="problem-adding-a-non-gallery-application"></a>Problem adding a non-gallery application

This article help you to understand the common problems people face when adding **custom non-gallery applications** and what you can do to resolve them. 

## <a name="i-clicked-the-add-button-and-my-application-took-a-long-time-to-appear"></a>I clicked the “add” button and my application took a long time to appear

Under some circumstances, it can take 1-2 minutes (and sometimes longer) for an application to appear after adding it to your directory. While this is not the normal expected performance, you can see the application addition is in progress by clicking on the **Notifications** icon (the bell) in the upper right of the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and looking for an **In Progress** or **Completed** notification labeled **Create application**.

If your application is never added, or you encounter an error when clicking the **Add** button, you’ll see a **Notification** in an **Error** state. If you want more details about the error to learn more to or share with a support engingeer, you can see more information about the error by following the steps in the [How to see the details of a portal notification](#how-to-see-the-details-of-a-portal-notification) section.

## <a name="i-clicked-the-add-button-and-my-application-didnt-appear"></a>I clicked the “add” button and my application didn’t appear

Sometimes, due to transient issues, networking problems, or a bug, adding an application fail. You can tell this happens when you click the **Notifications** icon (the bell) in the upper right of the Azure Portal and you see a red (!) icon next to your **Create application** notification. This indicates there was an error when creating the application.

If you encounter an error when clicking the **Add** button, you’ll see a **Notification** in an **Error** state. If you want more details about the error to learn more to or share with a support engingeer, you can see more information about the error by following the steps in the [How to see the details of a portal notification](#how-to-see-the-details-of-a-portal-notification) section.

## <a name="i-dont-know-how-to-set-up-my-application-once-ive-added-it"></a>I don’t know how to set up my application once I’ve added it

If you need help learning about custom applications, the [Azure AD Applications Document Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-apps-index) help you to learn more about single sign-on with Azure AD and how it works.
