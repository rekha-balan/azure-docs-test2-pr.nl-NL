This document walks you through installing and configuring the Azure AD Connect Health Agents. You can download the agents from [here](active-directory-aadconnect-health.md#download-and-install-azure-ad-connect-health-agent).

## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements
The following table is a list of requirements for using Azure AD Connect Health.

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Azure AD Premium |Azure AD Connect Health is an Azure AD Premium feature and requires Azure AD Premium. </br></br>For more information, see [Getting started with Azure AD Premium](../active-directory-get-started-premium.md) </br>To start a free 30-day trial, see [Start a trial.](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/) |
| You must be a global administrator of your Azure AD to get started with Azure AD Connect Health |By default, only the global administrators can install and configure the health agents to get started, access the portal, and perform any operations within Azure AD Connect Health. For more information, see [Administering your Azure AD directory](../active-directory-administer.md). <br><br> Using Role Based Access Control you can allow access to Azure AD Connect Health to other users in your organization. For more information, see [Role Based Access Control for Azure AD Connect Health.](active-directory-aadconnect-health-operations.md#manage-access-with-role-based-access-control) </br></br>**Important:** The account used when installing the agents must be a work or school account. It cannot be a Microsoft account. For more information, see [Sign up for Azure as an organization](../sign-up-organization.md) |
| Azure AD Connect Health Agent is installed on each targeted server | Azure AD Connect Health requires the Health Agents to be installed and configured on targeted servers to receive the data and provide the Monitoring and Analytics capabilities </br></br>For example, to get data from your AD FS infrastructure, the agent must be installed on the AD FS and Web Application Proxy servers. Similarly, to get data on your on-premises AD DS infrastructure, the agent must be installed on the domain controllers. </br></br> |
| Outbound connectivity to the Azure service endpoints | During installation and runtime, the agent requires connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints. If outbound connectivity is blocked using Firewalls, ensure that the following endpoints are added to the allowed list: </br></br><li>&#42;.blob.core.windows.net </li><li>&#42;.servicebus.windows.net - Port: 5671 </li><li>&#42;.adhybridhealth.azure.com/</li><li>https://management.azure.com </li><li>https://policykeyservice.dc.ad.msft.net/</li><li>https://login.windows.net</li><li>https://login.microsoftonline.com</li><li>https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com</li> |
|Outbound connectivity based on IP Addresses | For IP address based filtering on firewalls, refer to the [Azure IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41653).|
| SSL Inspection for outbound traffic is filtered or disabled | The agent registration step or data upload operations may fail if there is SSL inspection or termination for outbound traffic at the network layer. |
| Firewall ports on the server running the agent. |The agent requires the following firewall ports to be open in order for the agent to communicate with the Azure AD Health service endpoints.</br></br><li>TCP port 443</li><li>TCP port 5671</li> |

## <a name="test-connectivity-to-azure-ad-connect-health-service"></a>Test Connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health Service
It is possible that issues may arise that cause the Azure AD Connect Health agent to lose connectivity with the Azure AD Connect Health service. These include network issues, permission issues, or various other reasons.

If the agent is unable to send data to the Azure AD Connect Health service for longer than two hours, it is indicated with the following alert in the portal: "Health Service data is not up to date." You can confirm if the affected Azure AD Connect Health agent is able to upload data to the Azure AD Connect Health service by running the following PowerShell command:

    Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity -Role ADFS

The role parameter currently takes the following values:

* ADFS
* Sync
* ADDS

You can use the -ShowResults flag in the command to view detailed logs. Use the following example:

    Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity -Role Sync -ShowResult

> [!NOTE]
> To use the connectivity tool, you must first complete the agent registration. If you are not able to complete the agent registration, make sure that you have met all the [requirements](active-directory-aadconnect-health-agent-install.md#requirements) for Azure AD Connect Health. This connectivity test is performed by default during agent registration.
