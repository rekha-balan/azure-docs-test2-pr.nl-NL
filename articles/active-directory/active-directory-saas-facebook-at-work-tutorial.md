# <a name="tutorial-azure-active-directory-integration-with-workplace-by-facebook"></a>Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workplace by Facebook
The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate Workplace by Facebook with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Workplace by Facebook with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits: 

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Workplace by Facebook 
* You can automatically provision account for users who have been granted access to Workplace by Facebook
* You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Workplace by Facebook (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
* You can manage your accounts in one central location 

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
To configure Azure AD integration with CS Stars, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription
* Workplace by Facebook with single sign on enabled

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

* You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
* If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). 

## <a name="adding-workplace-by-facebook-from-the-gallery"></a>Adding Workplace by Facebook from the gallery
To configure the integration of Workplace by Facebook into Azure AD, you need to add Workplace by Facebook from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Workplace by Facebook from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure classic portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. 
   
    ![Active Directory][1]
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.
3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.
   
    ![Applications][2]
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.
   
    ![Applications][3]

### <a name="configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on"></a>Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On
This section outlines how to enable users to authenticate to Workplace by Facebook with their account in Azure Active Directory, using federation based on the SAML protocol.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Workplace by Facebook, perform the following steps:**

1. After adding Workplace by Facebook in the Azure classic portal, click **Configure Single Sign-On**.
2. In the **Configure App URL** screen, enter the URL where users will sign into your Workplace by Facebook application. This is your Workplace by Facebook tenant URL (Example: https://example.facebook.com/). Once finished, click **Next**.
3. In a different web browser window, log into your Workplace by Facebook company site as an administrator.
4. Follow the instructions at the following URL to configure Workplace by Facebook to use Azure AD as an identity provider: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/authentication/cloud-providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/authentication/cloud-providers)
5. Once completed, return to the browser windows showing the Azure classic portal, click the checkbox to confirm you have completed the procedure, then click **Next** and **Complete**.


## <a name="automatically-provisioning-users-to-workplace-by-facebook"></a>Automatically provisioning users to Workplace by Facebook
Azure AD supports the ability to automatically synchonize the account details of assigned users to Workplace by Facebook. This automatic sychronization enables Workplace by Facebook to get the data it needs to authorize users for access, in advance of them attempting to sign-in for the first time. It also de-provisions users from Workplace by Facebook when access has been revoked in Azure AD.

Automatic provisioning can be set up by clicking **Configure account provisioning** in the Azure classic portal window.

For additional details on how to configure automatic provisioning, see [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/provisioning/cloud-providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/provisioning/cloud-providers)

## <a name="assigning-users-to-workplace-by-facebook"></a>Assigning users to Workplace by Facebook
For provisioned AAD users to be able to see Workplace by Facebook on their Access Panel, they must be assigned access inside the Azure classic portal.

**To assign users to Workplace by Facebook:**

1. On the start page for Workplace by Facebook in the Azure classic portal, click **Assign accounts**.
2. In the **Show** menu, select whether you want to assign a user or a group to Workplace by Facebook and click the Checkmark button.
3. In the resulting list, select the users or group to whom you want to assign Workplace by Facebook.
4. In the page footer, click the **Assign** button.
