# <a name="enabling-azure-active-directory-identity-protection"></a>Enabling Azure Active Directory Identity Protection
Azure Active Directory Identity Protection is a new capability that provides a consolidated view into suspicious sign-in activities and potential vulnerabilities and with notifications, remediation recommendations and risk-based policies helps you protect your business. 

The service detects suspicious activities for end user and privileged (admin) identities based on signals like brute force attacks, leaked credentials, sign ins from unfamiliar locations, infected devices, to protect against these activities in real-time. More importantly, based on these suspicious activities, a user risk severity is computed and risk-based policies can be configured and automatically protect the identities of your organization. For more details, see [Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](active-directory-identityprotection.md).

This topics shows how to enable Azure Active Directory Identity Protection.
