<!--### Next steps

To ensure users can sign-in to Bambu by Sprout Social after it has been configured to use Azure Active Directory, review the following tasks and topics:

- User accounts must be pre-provisioned into Bambu by Sprout Social prior to sign-in. To set this up, see Provisioning.
 
- Users must be assigned access to Bambu by Sprout Social in Azure AD to sign-in. To assign users, see Users.
 
- To configure access polices for Bambu by Sprout Social users, see Access Policies.
 
- For additional information on deploying single sign-on to users, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis#deploying-azure-ad-integrated-applications-to-users).-->
