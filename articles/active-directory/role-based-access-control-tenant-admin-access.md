# <a name="elevate-access-as-a-tenant-admin-with-role-based-access-control"></a>Elevate access as a tenant admin with Role-Based Access Control

Role-based Access Control helps tenant administrators get temporary elevations in access so that they can grant higher permissions than normal. A tenant admin can elevate herself to the User Access Administrator role when needed. That role gives the tenant admin permissions to grant herself or others roles at the "/" scope.

This feature is important because it allows the tenant admin to see all the subscriptions that exist in an organization. It also allows for automation apps (like invoicing and auditing) to access all the subscriptions and provide an accurate view of the state of the organization from a billing or asset management perspective.  

## <a name="how-to-use-elevateaccess-to-give-tenant-access"></a>How to use elevateAccess to give tenant access

The basic process works with the following steps:

1. Using REST, call *elevateAccess*, which grants you the User Access Administrator role at "/" scope.

    ```
    POST https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess?api-version=2016-07-01
    ```

2. Create a [role assignment](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments) to assign any role at any scope. The following example shows the properties for assigning the Reader role at "/" scope:

    ```
    { "properties":{
    "roleDefinitionId": "providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/acdd72a7338548efbd42f606fba81ae7",
    "principalId": "cbc5e050-d7cd-4310-813b-4870be8ef5bb",
    "scope": "/"
    },
    "id": "providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/64736CA0-56D7-4A94-A551-973C2FE7888B",
    "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
    "name": "64736CA0-56D7-4A94-A551-973C2FE7888B"
    }
    ```

3. While a User Access Admin, you can also delete role assignments at "/" scope.

4. Revoke your User Access Admin privileges until they're needed again.


## <a name="how-to-undo-the-elevateaccess-action"></a>How to undo the elevateAccess action

When you call *elevateAccess* you create a role assignment for yourself, so to revoke those privileges you need to delete the assignment.

1.  Call [GET roleDefinitions](/rest/api/authorization/roledefinitions#RoleDefinitions_Get) where roleName = User Access Administrator to determine the name GUID of the User Access Administrator role. The response should look like this:

    ```
    {"value":[{"properties":{
    "roleName":"User Access Administrator",
    "type":"BuiltInRole",
    "description":"Lets you manage user access to Azure resources.",
    "assignableScopes":["/"],
    "permissions":[{"actions":["*/read","Microsoft.Authorization/*","Microsoft.Support/*"],"notActions":[]}],
    "createdOn":"0001-01-01T08:00:00.0000000Z",
    "updatedOn":"2016-05-31T23:14:04.6964687Z",
    "createdBy":null,
    "updatedBy":null},
    "id":"/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/18d7d88d-d35e-4fb5-a5c3-7773c20a72d9",
    "type":"Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions",
    "name":"18d7d88d-d35e-4fb5-a5c3-7773c20a72d9"}],
    "nextLink":null}
    ```

    Save the GUID from the *name* parameter, in this case **18d7d88d-d35e-4fb5-a5c3-7773c20a72d9**.

2. Call [GET roleAssignments](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments#RoleAssignments_Get) where principalId = your own ObjectId. This lists all your assignments in the tenant. Look for the one where the scope is "/" and the RoleDefinitionId ends with the role name GUID you found in step 1. The role assignment should look like this:

    ```
    {"value":[{"properties":{
    "roleDefinitionId":"/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/18d7d88d-d35e-4fb5-a5c3-7773c20a72d9",
    "principalId":"{objectID}",
    "scope":"/",
    "createdOn":"2016-08-17T19:21:16.3422480Z",
    "updatedOn":"2016-08-17T19:21:16.3422480Z",
    "createdBy":"93ce6722-3638-4222-b582-78b75c5c6d65",
    "updatedBy":"93ce6722-3638-4222-b582-78b75c5c6d65"},
    "id":"/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/e7dd75bc-06f6-4e71-9014-ee96a929d099",
    "type":"Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
    "name":"e7dd75bc-06f6-4e71-9014-ee96a929d099"}],
    "nextLink":null}
    ```

    Again, save the GUID from the *name* parameter, in this case **e7dd75bc-06f6-4e71-9014-ee96a929d099**.

3. Finally, call [DELETE roleAssignments](/rest/api/authorization/roleassignments#RoleAssignments_DeleteById) where roleAssignmentId = the name GUID you found in step 2.
