# <a name="view-or-search-for-your-user-groups-in-azure-active-directory"></a>View or search for your user groups in Azure Active Directory
This article explains how to view all groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) preview. [What's in the preview?](active-directory-preview-explainer.md) One of the features of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user management is the ability to create groups that you can populate with your users. You use a group to perform management tasks such as assigning licenses or permissions to a number of users at once.

## <a name="how-do-i-see-all-the-groups"></a>How do I see all the groups?
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **More services**, enter **Users and groups** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **All groups**.

4. On the **Users and groups - All groups** blade, you can add or remove display columns, filter the list to search for a group, or make changes to groups that you have sufficient permissions to change.
