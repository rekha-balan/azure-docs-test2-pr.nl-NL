# <a name="tutorial-azure-active-directory-integration-with-recognize"></a>Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Recognize
The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate Recognize with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Recognize with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Recognize
* You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Recognize single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure classic portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
To configure Azure AD integration with Recognize, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription
* A Recognize single-sign on (SSO) enabled subscription

 >[!NOTE]
 >To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment. 
 > 

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

* You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
* If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## <a name="scenario-description"></a>Scenario description
The objective of this tutorial is to enable you to test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Recognize from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD SSO

## <a name="adding-recognize-from-the-gallery"></a>Adding Recognize from the gallery
To configure the integration of Recognize into Azure AD, you need to add Recognize from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Recognize from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure classic Portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. 
   
    ![Active Directory][1]
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.
3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.
   
    ![Applications][2]
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.
   
    ![Applications][3]
5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.
   
    ![Applications][4]
6. In the search box, type **Recognize**.
   
    ![Creating an Azure AD test user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-saas-recognize-tutorial/tutorial_recognize_01.png)
7. In the results panel, select **Recognize**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.
   
    ![Selecting the app in the gallery](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-saas-recognize-tutorial/tutorial_recognize_0001.png)

## <a name="configure-and-test-azure-ad-sso"></a>Configure and test Azure AD SSO
The objective of this section is to show you how to configure and test Azure AD SSO with Recognize based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For SSO to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Recognize to an user in Azure AD is. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Recognize needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in Recognize.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Recognize, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD single sign-on](#configuring-azure-ad-single-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Recognize test user](#creating-a-recognize-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Recognize that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing single sign-on](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### <a name="configure-azure-ad-sso"></a>Configure Azure AD SSO
In this section, you enable Azure AD SSO in the classic portal and configure SSO in your Recognize application.

**To configure Azure AD SSO with Recognize, perform the following steps:**

  1. In the **Sign On URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://recognizeapp.com/<your-domain>/saml/sso`. 
  2. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://recognizeapp.com/<your-domain>/saml/metadata`.
  3. Click **Next**.
