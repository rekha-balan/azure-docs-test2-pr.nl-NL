# <a name="tutorial-azure-active-directory-integration-with-sap-hana-cloud-platform-identity-authentication"></a>Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication is used as a proxy IdP to access SAP applications using Azure AD as the main IdP.

Integrating SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to SAP application
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to SAP applications single sign-on (SSO) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure classic portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).


## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A **SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication** SSO enabled subscription


>[!NOTE] 
>To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.
>

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a [one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## <a name="scenario-description"></a>Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD SSO

Before diving into the technical details, it is vital to understand the concepts you're going to look at. The SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication and Azure Active Directory federation enables you to implement SSO across applications or services protected by AAD (as an IdP) with SAP applications and services protected by SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.

Currently, SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication acts as a Proxy Identity Provider to SAP-applications. Azure Active Directory in turn acts as the leading Identity Provider in this setup. 

The following diagram illustrates this:    

![Creating an Azure AD test user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-saas-sap-hana-cloud-tutorial/architecture-01.png)

With this setup, your SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication tenant will be configured as a trusted application in Azure Active Directory. 

All SAP applications and services you want to protect through this way are subsequently configured in the SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication management console!

This means that authorization for granting access to SAP applications and services needs to take place in SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication for such a setup (as opposed to configuring authorization in Azure Active Directory).

By configuring SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication as an application through the Azure Active Directory Marketplace, you don't need to take care of configuring needed individual claims / SAML assertions and transformations needed to produce a valid authentication token for SAP applications.

>[!NOTE] 
>Currently Web SSO has been tested by both parties, only. Flows needed for App-to-API or API-to-API communication should work but have not been tested, yet. They will be tested as part of subsequent activities.

## <a name="add-sap-hana-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-from-the-gallery"></a>Add SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery
To configure the integration of SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication into Azure AD, you need to add SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the [**Azure Management portal**](https://portal.azure.com), on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

    ![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

    ![Applications][2]
    
3. Click **Add** button on the top of the dialog.

    ![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication**.

    ![Creating an Azure AD test user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-saas-sap-hana-cloud-tutorial/tutorial_sap_cloud_identity_01.png)

5. In the results panel, select **SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

    ![Creating an Azure AD test user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-saas-sap-hana-cloud-tutorial/tutorial_sap_cloud_identity_02.png)


##  <a name="configure-and-test-azure-ad-single-sign-on"></a>Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD SSO with SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For SSO to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD single sign-on](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication test user](#creating-a-sap-hana-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing single sign-on](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### <a name="configuring-azure-ad-sso"></a>Configuring Azure AD SSO

In this section, you enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure Management portal and configure single sign-on in your SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication application.

SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. You can manage the values of these attributes from the "**User Attributes**" section on application integration page. The following screenshot shows an example for this.

![Configure Single Sign-On](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-saas-sap-hana-cloud-tutorial/tutorial_sap_cloud_identity_03.png)

### <a name="create-a-sap-hana-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-test-user"></a>Create a SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication test user

You don't need to create an user on SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication. Users who are in the Azure AD user store can use the SSO functionality.

SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication supports the Identity Federation option. This option allows the application to check if the users authenticated by the corporate identity provider exist in the user store of SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication. 

In the default setting, the Identity Federation option is disabled. If Identity Federation is enabled, only the users that are imported in SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication are able to access the application. 

For more information about how to enable or disable Identity Federation with SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, see Enable Identity Federation with SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication in [Configure Identity Federation with the User Store of SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/cloud_identity/frameset.htm?c029bbbaefbf4350af15115396ba14e2.html).

### <a name="assign-the-azure-ad-test-user"></a>Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting her access to SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.

![Assign User][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to SAP HANA Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure Management portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

    ![Assign User][201]
