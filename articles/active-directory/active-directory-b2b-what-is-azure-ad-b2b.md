# <a name="what-is-azure-ad-b2b-collaboration"></a>What is Azure AD B2B collaboration?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhwrweCBdsc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Azure AD business-to-business (B2B) collaboration capabilities enable any organization using Azure AD to work safely and securely with users from any other organization – small or large; with Azure AD or without; in fact, with an IT organization or without. 

Organizations using Azure AD can provide access to documents, resources, and applications to their partners, all while maintaining complete control over corporate data. Developers can use the Azure AD business-to-business APIs to write applications that bring two organizations together in a secure way that is also seamless and intuitive for end users to navigate.

A whopping **97%** of our customers have told us Azure AD B2B collaboration is very important to them.

As of early April, 2017, we had about 3 million users already using Azure AD B2B collaboration capabilities. And more than 23% of Azure AD organizations that have more than 10 users are already benefiting from these capabilities.

### <a name="enable-your-collaborators-to-bring-their-own-identity"></a>Enable your collaborators to bring their own identity

B2B collaborators can sign in with an identity of their choice. If the user doesn’t have an Microsoft account or and Azure AD account – one is created for them seamlessly at the time for offer redemption.

### <a name="delegate-to-application-and-group-owners"></a>Delegate to application and group owners 
Application and group owners can add B2B users directly to any application that you care about, whether it is a Microsoft application or not. Admins can delegate permission to add B2B users to non-admins. Non-admins can use the [Azure AD Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com) to add B2B collaboration users to applications or groups.

### <a name="authorization-policies-protect-your-corporate-content"></a>Authorization policies protect your corporate content

Admins can establish conditional access policies, like Multi-factor Authentication, can be enforced at the tenant level, the application level, or for specific users to protect corporate apps and data.
