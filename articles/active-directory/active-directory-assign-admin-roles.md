Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can designate separate administrators to serve different functions. These administrators will have access to various features in the Azure portal or Azure classic portal and, depending on their role, will be able to create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and manage domains, among other things. A user who is assigned an admin role will have the same permissions across all of the cloud services that your organization has subscribed to, regardless of whether you assign the role in the Office 365 portal, or in the Azure classic portal, or by using the Azure AD module for Windows PowerShell.

The following administrator roles are available:

* **Billing administrator**: Makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health.
* **Global administrator / Company Administrator**: Has access to all administrative features. The person who signs up for the Azure account becomes a global administrator. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles. There can be more than one global administrator at your company.
