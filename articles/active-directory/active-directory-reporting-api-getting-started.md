# <a name="getting-started-with-the-azure-active-directory-reporting-api"></a>Getting started with the Azure Active Directory reporting API
*This topic is part of the [Azure Active Directory Reporting Guide](active-directory-reporting-guide.md).*

Azure Active Directory provides you with a variety of reports. The data of these reports can be very useful to your applications, such as SIEM systems, audit, and business intelligence tools. The Azure AD reporting APIs provide programmatic access to the data through a set of REST-based APIs. You can call these APIs from a variety of programming languages and tools.

This article provides you with the information you need to get started with the Azure AD reporting APIs.
In the next section, you find more details about using the audit and sign-in APIs. For all other APIs, see the [Azure AD reports and events (preview)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-reports-and-events-preview) article.

For questions, issues or feedback, please contact [AAD Reporting Help](mailto:aadreportinghelp@microsoft.com).

1. **Prepare** - Before you can test your API samples, you need to complete the [prerequisites to access the Azure AD reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-prerequisites.md).
2. **Explore** - Get a first impression of the reporting APIs:
   
   * [Using the samples for the audit API](active-directory-reporting-api-audit-samples.md) 
   * [Using the samples for the sign-in activity report API](active-directory-reporting-api-sign-in-activity-samples.md)
3. **Customize** -  Create your own solution: 
   
   * [Using the audit API reference](active-directory-reporting-api-audit-reference.md) 
   * [Using the sign-in activity report API reference](active-directory-reporting-api-sign-in-activity-reference.md)
