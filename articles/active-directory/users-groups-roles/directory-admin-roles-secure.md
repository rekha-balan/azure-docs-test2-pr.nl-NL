<!--## Risk management, incident response, and recovery preparation

A cyber-attack, if successful, can shut down operations not just for a few hours, but in some cases for days or even weeks. The collateral damage, such as legal ramifications, information leaks, and media coverage, could potentially continue for years. To ensure effective company-wide risk containment, cybersecurity and IT pros must align their response and recovery processes. To reduce the risk of business disruption due to a cyber-attack, industry experts recommend you do the following:

* As part of your risk management operations, establish a crisis management team for your organization that is responsible for managing all types of business disruptions.

* Compare your current risk mitigations, incident response, and recovery plan with industry best practices for managing a business disruption before, during, and after a cyber-attack.

* Develop and implement a roadmap for closing the gaps between your current plans and the best practices described in this document.
