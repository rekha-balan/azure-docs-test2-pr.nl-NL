# <a name="troubleshooting-dynamic-memberships-for-groups"></a>Troubleshooting dynamic memberships for groups

**I configured a rule on a group but no memberships get updated in the group**<br/>Verify the values for user attributes on the rule: are there users that satisfy the rule? If everything looks good, please allow some time for the group to populate. Depending on the size of your tenant, the group may take up to 24 hours for populating for the first time or after a rule change.

**I configured a rule, but now the existing members of the rule are removed**<br/>This is expected behavior. Existing members of the group are removed when a rule is enabled or changed. The users returned from evaluation of the rule are added as members to the group.

**I donâ€™t see membership changes instantly when I add or change a rule, why not?**<br/>Dedicated membership evaluation is done periodically in an asynchronous background process. How long the process takes is determined by the number of users in your directory and the size of the group created as a result of the rule. Typically, directories with small numbers of users will see the group membership changes in less than a few minutes. Directories with a large number of users can take 30 minutes or longer to populate.

**I encountered a rule processing error**<br/>The following table lists common dynamic membership rule errors and how to correct them.

| Rule parser error | Error usage | Corrected usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Error: Attribute not supported. |(user.invalidProperty -eq "Value") |(user.department -eq "value")<br/><br/>Make sure the attribute is on the [supported properties list](groups-dynamic-membership.md#supported-properties). |
| Error: Operator is not supported on attribute. |(user.accountEnabled -contains true) |(user.accountEnabled -eq true)<br/><br/>The operator used is not supported for the property type (in this example, -contains cannot be used on type boolean). Use the correct operators for the property type. |
| Error: Query compilation error. | 1. (user.department -eq "Sales") (user.department -eq "Marketing")<br>2.  (user.userPrincipalName -match "*@domain.ext") | 1. Missing operator. Use -and or -or two join predicates<br>(user.department -eq "Sales") -or (user.department -eq "Marketing")<br>2. Error in regular expression used with -match<br>(user.userPrincipalName -match ".*@domain.ext")<br>or alternatively: (user.userPrincipalName -match "@domain.ext$") |
