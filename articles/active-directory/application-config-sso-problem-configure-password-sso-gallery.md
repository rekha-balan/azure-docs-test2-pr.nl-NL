# <a name="problem-configuring-password-single-sign-on-for-an-azure-ad-gallery-application"></a>Problem configuring password single sign-on for an Azure AD Gallery application

This article help you to understand the common problems people face when configuring **Password Single Sign-on** with an Azure AD Gallery application.

## <a name="credentials-are-filled-in-but-the-extension-does-not-submit-them"></a>Credentials are filled in, but the extension does not submit them

This typically happens if the application vendor has changed their sign in page recently to add a field, change an underlying identifier we used to detect the username and password fields, or modify how the sign in experience works for their application. Fortunately, in many instances, Microsoft can work with application vendors to rapidly resolve these issues.

While Microsoft has technologies to automatically detect when these integrations break, but sometimes we are not able to find these issues right away, or they take some time to fix. In the case when one of these integrations does not work correctly, we would appreciate if you opened a support case so we can fix it as quickly as possible.

In addition to this, **if you are in contact with this application’s vendor,** **send them our way** so we can work with them to natively integrate their application with Azure Active Directory. You can send the vendor to the [Listing your application in the Azure Active Directory application gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-app-gallery-listing) to get them started.

## <a name="credentials-are-filled-in-and-submitted-but-the-page-indicates-the-credentials-are-incorrect"></a>Credentials are filled in and submitted, but the page indicates the credentials are incorrect

To resolve this issue, first check the following:

-   Have the user first try to **sign in to the application website directly** with the credentials stored for them.

  * If that works, then have the user click the **Update credentials** button on the **Application Tile** in the **Apps** section of the [Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com/) to update them to the latest known working username and password.

   * If you, or another administrator assigned the credentials for this user, find the user or group’s application assignment by navigating to the **Users & Groups** tab of the application, selecting the assignment and clicking the **Update Credentials** button.

-   If the user assigned their own credentials, have the user **check to be sure that their password has not expired in the application** and if so, **update their expired password** by signing in to the application directly.

   * After the password has been updated in the application, request the user to click the **Update credentials** button on the **Application Tile** in the **Apps** section of the [Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com/) to update them to the latest known working username and password.

   * If you, or another administrator assigned the credentials for this user, find the user or group’s application assignment by navigating to the **Users & Groups** tab of the application, selecting the assignment and clicking the **Update Credentials** button.

-   Have the user update the access panel browser extension by following the steps below in the [How to install the Access Panel Browser extension](#how-to-install-the-access-panel-browser-extension) section.

-   Ensure that the access panel browser extension is running and enabled in your user’s browser.

-   Ensure that your users are not trying to sign in to the application from the access panel while in **incognito, inPrivate, or Private mode**. The access panel extension is not supported in these modes.

In case this does not work, it could be the case that a change has occurred on the application side which has temporarily broken the application’s integration with Azure AD. For example, this can occur when the application vendor introduces a script on their page which behaves differently for manual vs automated input, which causes automated integration, like our own, to break. Fortunately, in many instances, Microsoft can work with application vendors to rapidly resolve these issues.

While Microsoft has technologies to automatically detect when these integrations break, but sometimes we are not able to find these issues right away, or they take some time to fix. In the case when one of these integrations does not work correctly, we would appreciate if you opened a support case so we can fix it as quickly as possible.

In addition to this, **if you are in contact with this application’s vendor,** **send them our way** so we can work with them to natively integrate their application with Azure Active Directory. You can send the vendor to the [Listing your application in the Azure Active Directory application gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-app-gallery-listing) to get them started.

## <a name="the-extension-works-in-chrome-and-firefox-but-not-in-internet-explorer"></a>The extension works in Chrome and Firefox, but not in Internet Explorer

There are two main causes to this issue:

-   Depending on the security settings enabled in Internet Explorer, if the website is not part of a **Trusted Zone**, sometimes our script be blocked from executing for the application.

  *  To resolve this, instruct the user to **Add the application’s website** to the **Trusted Sites** list within their **Internet Explorer security settings**. You can send your users to the [How to add a site to my trusted sites list](https://answers.microsoft.com/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/how-do-i-add-a-site-to-my-trusted-sites-list/98cc77c8-b364-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5) article for detailed instructions.

-   In rare circumstances, Internet Explorer’s security validation can sometimes cause the page to load more slowly than the execution of our script.

   * Unfortunately, this situation can vary depending on the browser version, computer speed, or site visited. In this case, we suggest that you contact support so we can fix the integration for this specific application.

In addition to this, **if you are in contact with this application’s vendor,** **send them our way** so we can work with them to natively integrate their application with Azure Active Directory. You can send the vendor to the [Listing your application in the Azure Active Directory application gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-app-gallery-listing) to get them started.

## <a name="check-if-the-applications-login-page-has-changed-recently-or-requires-an-additional-field"></a>Check if the application’s login page has changed recently or requires an additional field

If the application’s login page has changed drastically, sometimes this causes our integrations to break. An example of this is when an application vendor adds a sign in field, a captcha, or multi-factor authentication to their experiences. Fortunately, in many instances, Microsoft can work with application vendors to rapidly resolve these issues.

While Microsoft has technologies to automatically detect when these integrations break, but sometimes we are not able to find these issues right away. Otherwise they take some time to fix. In the case when one of these integrations does not work correctly, we would appreciate opening a support case so we can fix it as quickly as possible.

## <a name="how-to-install-the-access-panel-browser-extension"></a>How to install the Access Panel Browser extension

To install the Access Panel Browser extension, follow the steps below:

1.  Open the [Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com) in one of the supported browsers and sign in as a **user** in your Azure AD.

2.  click a **password-SSO application** in the Access Panel.

3.  In the prompt asking to install the software, select **Install Now**.

4.  Based on your browser you be directed to the download link. **Add** the extension to your browser.

5.  If your browser asks, select to either **Enable** or **Allow** the extension.

6.  Once installed, **restart** your browser session.

7.  Sign in into the Access Panel and see if you can **launch** your password-SSO applications

You may also download the extension for Chrome and Firefox from the direct links below:
