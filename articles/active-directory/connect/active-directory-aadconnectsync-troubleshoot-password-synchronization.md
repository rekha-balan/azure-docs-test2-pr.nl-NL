# <a name="troubleshoot-password-synchronization-with-azure-ad-connect-sync"></a>Troubleshoot password synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync
This topic provides steps for how to troubleshoot issues with password synchronization. If passwords are not synchronizing as expected, it can either be for a subset of users or for all users.

* If you have an issue where no passwords are synchronized, see [Troubleshoot issues where no passwords are synchronized](#no-passwords-are-synchronized).
* If you have an issue with individual objects, then see [Troubleshoot one object that is not synchronizing passwords](#one-object-is-not-synchronizing-passwords).

## <a name="no-passwords-are-synchronized"></a>No passwords are synchronized
Follow these steps to figure out why no passwords are synchronized:

1. Is the Connect server in [staging mode](active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations.md#staging-mode)? A server in staging mode does not synchronize any passwords.
2. Run the script in the section [Get the status of password sync settings](#get-the-status-of-password-sync-settings). It gives you an overview of the password sync configuration.  
![PowerShell script output from password sync settings](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/psverifyconfig.png)  
3. If the feature is not enabled in Azure AD or if the sync channel status is not enabled, then run the Connect installation wizard. Select **Customize synchronization options** and unselect password sync. This change temporarily disables the feature. Then run the wizard again and re-enable password sync. Run the script again to verify that the configuration is correct.
4. Look in the eventlog for errors. Look for the following events, which would indicate a problem:
    1. Source: "Directory synchronization" ID: 0, 611, 652, 655 If you see these, you have a connectivity problem. The eventlog message contains forest information where you have a problem. For more information, see [Connectivity problem](#connectivity problem)
5. If you see no heartbeat or if nothing else worked, then run [Trigger a full sync of all passwords](#trigger-a-full-sync-of-all-passwords). You should only run this script once.
6. Read the section [Troubleshoot one object that is not synchronizing passwords](#one-object-is-not-synchronizing-passwords).

### <a name="connectivity-problem"></a>Connectivity problem

1. Do you have connectivity with Azure AD.
2. Does the account have required permissions to read the password hashes in all domains? If you installed Connect using Express settings, the permissions should already be correct. If you used custom install, you need to set the permissions manually.
    1. To find the account used by the Active Directory Connector, start **Synchronization Service Manager**. Go to **Connectors** and find the on-premises Active Directory forest you are troubleshooting. Select the Connector and click **Properties**. Go to **Connect to Active Directory Forest**.  
    ![Account used by AD Connector](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/connectoraccount.png)  
    Take a note of the username and the domain the account is located in.
    2. Start **Active Directory Users and Computers**. Verify that the account you found in the previous steps have the follow permissions set at the root of all domains in your forest:
        * Replicate Directory Changes
        * Replicate Directory Changes All
3. Are the domain controllers reachable by Azure AD Connect? If the Connect server cannot connect to all domain controllers, then you should configure **Only use preferred domain controller**.  
    ![Domain controller used by AD Connector](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/preferreddc.png)  
    Go back to **Synchronization Service Manager** and **Configure Directory Partition**. Select your domain in **Select directory partitions**, select the checkbox **Only use preferred domain controllers**, and click **Configure**. In the list, enter the domain controllers Connect should use for password sync. The same list is used for import and export as well. Do these steps for all your domains.
4. If the script shows that there is no heartbeat, then run the script in [Trigger a full sync of all passwords](#trigger-a-full-sync-of-all-passwords).

## <a name="one-object-is-not-synchronizing-passwords"></a>One object is not synchronizing passwords
You can easily troubleshoot password synchronization issues by reviewing the status of an object.

1. Start in **Active Directory Users and Computers**. Find the user and verify that **User must change password at next logon** is unselected.  
![Active Directory productive passwords](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/adprodpassword.png)  
If it is selected, then ask the user to sign in and change the password. Temporary passwords are not synchronized to Azure AD.
2. If it looks correct in Active Directory, then the next step is to follow the user in the sync engine. By following the user from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD, you can see if there is a descriptive error on the object.
    1. Start the **[Synchronization Service Manager](active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui.md)**.
    2. Click **Connectors**.
    3. Select the **Active Directory Connector** the user is located in.
    4. Select **Search Connector Space**.
    5. In **Scope**, select **DN or anchor**. Enter the full DN of the user you are troubleshooting.
    ![Search for user in cs with DN](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/searchcs.png)  
    6. Locate the user you are looking for and click **Properties** to see all attributes. If the user is not in the search result, then verify your [filtering rules](active-directory-aadconnectsync-configure-filtering.md) and make sure you run [Apply and verify changes](active-directory-aadconnectsync-configure-filtering.md#apply-and-verify-changes) for the user to appear in Connect.
    7. To see the password sync details of the object for the past week, click **Log...**.  
    ![Object log details](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/csobjectlog.png)  
    If the object log is empty, then Azure AD Connect has not been able to read the password hash from Active Directory. Continue your troubleshooting with [Connectivity Errors](#connectivity-errors). If you see any other value than **success**, then refer to the table in [Password sync log](#password-sync-log).
    8. Select the **lineage** tab and make sure that at least one Sync Rule shows **Password Sync** as **True**. In the default configuration, the name of the Sync Rule is **In from AD - User AccountEnabled**.  
    ![Lineage information about a user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/cspasswordsync.png)  
    9. Click **Metaverse Object Properties**. You see a list of attributes in the user.  
    ![Metaverse information](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/mvpasswordsync.png)  
    Verify that there is no attribute **cloudFiltered** present. Make sure that the domain attributes (domainFQDN and domainNetBios) have the expected values.
    10. Click the tab **Connectors**. Make sure you see connectors to both your on-premises AD and to Azure AD.
    ![Metaverse information](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/mvconnectors.png)  
    11. Select the row representing Azure AD and click **Properties**. Click the tab **Lineage**. The connector space object should have an outbound rule with **Password Sync** set to **True**. In the default configuration, the name of the sync rule is **Out to AAD - User Join**.  
    ![Connector space properties of a user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization/cspasswordsync2.png)
