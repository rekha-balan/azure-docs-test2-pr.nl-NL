# <a name="what-is-single-sign-on-sso-preview"></a>What is Single Sign On (SSO) (preview)
Single sign-on is an option that can be enabled in Azure Active Directory Connect with either [Password synchronization](active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization.md) or [Pass-through authentication](active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication.md). When enabled, users only need to type their username and do not need to type their password to sign in to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or other cloud services when they are on their corporate machines and connected on the corporate network.

![Single sign-on](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnect-sso/sso1.png)

By providing your end users with SSO, access to cloud based services is more familiar and provides the organization with a secure and simple process that doesn’t require any additional on-premises components.

SSO is a feature that is enabled through Azure AD Connect and works with password sync or Pass-through authentication and your on-premises Active Directory. For your end users to use single sign-on in your environment, you need to ensure that users are:

- On a domain joined machine
- Have a direct connection to a domain controller, for example on the corporate wired or wireless network or via a remote access connection, such as a VPN connection.
- Define the Kerberos end-points in the cloud as part of the browser's Intranet zone.

If any of these requirements are not present, such as the machine is off the corporate network, then the user is prompted to enter their password as they would without single sign-on.

## <a name="supported-clients"></a>Supported Clients
Single sign-on is supported via web browser-based clients and Office clients that support [modern authentication](https://aka.ms/modernauthga) on machines capable of Kerberos authentication, such as Windows. The matrix below provides details of the browser-based clients on various operating systems.

| OS\Browser |Internet Explorer|Chrome|Firefox|Edge
| --- | --- |--- | --- | --- |
|Windows 10|Yes|Yes|Yes*|No
|Windows 8.1|Yes|Yes|Yes*|N/A
|Windows 8|Yes|Yes|Yes*|N/A
|Windows 7|Yes|Yes|Yes*|N/A
|Mac|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A

\*Requires separate configuration.

>[!NOTE]
>For Windows 10 based clients, the recommendation is to use [Azure AD join](../active-directory-azureadjoin-overview.md) for the best experience with Azure AD.

## <a name="how-single-sign-on-works"></a>How single sign-on works

When you enable single sign-on in Azure AD Connect, a computer account named AZUREADSSOACCT is created in the on-premises Active Directory and the Kerberos decryption key is shared securely with Azure AD. In addition, two Kerberos service principal names (SPNs) are created to represent the cloud URLs that are used during authentication between the client and Azure AD.

Once this setup is complete, the process of authentication is the same as any other Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) based application. If you are familiar with how IWA works, then you already know how single sign-on works with Azure AD. If you’re not familiar, the process for IWA is as follows:

![Single sign-on](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnect-sso/sso2.png)

First the user attempts to access a resource that trusts tokens issued from Azure AD, such as SharePoint Online. SharePoint Online then redirects the user to authenticate with Azure AD. The user then provides their username so that Azure AD can establish if single sign-on is enabled for their organization. Assuming single sign-on is enabled for the organization the following traffic occurs.

1.  Azure AD challenges the client, via a 401 Unauthorized response, to provide a Kerberos ticket.
2.  The client requests a ticket from Active Directory for Azure AD.
3.  Active Directory locates the machine account, created by Azure AD Connect, and returns a Kerberos ticket to the client encrypted with the machine account's secret. The ticket includes the identity of the user currently signed in to the computer.
4.  The client sends the Kerberos ticket it acquired from Active Directory to Azure AD.
5.  Azure AD decrypts the Kerberos ticket using the previously shared key. Then it either returns a token to the user or asks the user to provide additional proofs such as multi-factor authentication as required by the resource.

Single sign-on is an opportunistic feature, which means that if it fails for some reason, the user only needs to enter their password on the sign-in page as usual.

## <a name="single-sign-on-sso-prerequisites"></a>Single Sign On (SSO) prerequisites
If you are enabling ‘Single Sign On’ with ‘Pass-through authentication’, there are no additional pre-requisites beyond what is required for ‘Pass-through authentication’.

If you are enabling ‘Single Sign On’ with ‘Password Sync’, and if there is a firewall between Azure AD Connect and Azure AD, make sure that:
- The Azure AD Connect server can communicate with *.msappproxy.net
- Azure AD Connect can make HTTPS requests to Azure AD on the ports below:

|Protocol|Port Number|Description
| --- | --- | ---
|HTTPS|9090|    Enable SSO registration (required only for the SSO registration process).

## <a name="enabling-sso-with-pass-through-authentication-or-password-sync"></a>Enabling SSO with Pass-through Authentication or Password Sync
Azure AD Connect provides a simple process to enable single sign-on with Pass-through authentication or Password sync. Ensure that you have domain administrator rights to one of the domains within each forest you synchronize to allow the configuration of the Kerberos service principal names (SPNs) on the machine account. The username and password is not stored in Azure AD Connect or Azure AD and are used only for this operation.

When installing Azure AD Connect, select a custom installation so that you are able to select the single sign-on option on the user sign-in page. For more information, see [Custom installation of Azure AD Connect](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md).

![Single sign-on](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnect-sso/sso3.png)

Once single sign-on is enabled, you can continue through the installation wizard until you get to the Single sign-on page.

![Single sign-on](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnect-sso/sso4.png)

For each forest listed, provide the appropriate account details and single sign-on is enabled for your Azure directory.

>[!NOTE]
>Azure AD Connect needs to be able to communicate with \*.msappproxy.net on port 9090 (TCP) to configure SSO. This port opening is only necessary during configuration and is not used during authentications by end users.

## <a name="ensuring-clients-sign-in-automatically"></a>Ensuring Clients sign in automatically
By default, browsers do not attempt to send credentials to web servers unless the URL is defined as being in the Intranet zone. Generally, the browser can calculate the right zone by looking at the URL. For example, if the URL is http://intranet/ then the browser automatically send credentials as it maps to a URL in the intranet zone. However, if the URL contains a period, for example http://intranet.contoso.com/, then the computer does not automatically send credentials and treats the URL as it would any internet site.

Because the URLs used for single sign-on in Azure AD contain a period, they need to be explicitly added to the machine's Intranet zone. This setting makes the browser to automatically send the currently logged in user's credentials in the form of a Kerberos ticket to Azure AD. The easiest way to add the required URLs to the Intranet zone is to create a group policy in Active Directory.

1.  Open the Group Policy Management tools.
2.  Edit the Group policy that is applied to all users, for example the **Default Domain Policy**.
3.  Navigate to **User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer\Internet Control Panel\Security Page** and select **Site to Zone Assignment List**.
![Single sign-on](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnect-sso/sso6.png)  
4.  Enable the policy, and enter the following values/data in the dialog box.  

        Value: https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com  
        Data: 1  
        Value: https://aadg.windows.net.nsatc.net  
        Data: 1  
5.  It should look similar to the following:  
![Single sign-on](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnect-sso/sso7.png)

6.  Click **OK** and **OK** again.

Your users are now ready for single sign-on.

>[!NOTE]
>By default, Chrome uses the same set of trusted site URLs as Internet Explorer. If you have configured different settings for Chrome, then you need to update these sites separately.

## <a name="troubleshooting-single-sign-on-issues"></a>Troubleshooting single sign-on issues
It is important to make sure the client is correctly configured for single sign-on including the following:

1.  Both https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com and https://aadg.windows.net.nsatc.net are defined within the Intranet zone.
2.  Ensure the workstation is joined to the domain.
3.  Ensure the user is logged on with a domain account.
4.  Ensure the machine is connected to the corporate network.
5.  Ensure that the machine's time is synchronized with the Active Directory and the domain controllers time is within 5 minutes of the correct time.
6.  Purge the clients existing Kerberos tickets, for example by running the command **klist purge** from a command prompt.

If you have been able to confirm the above requirements, then you can review the console logs of the browser for additional information. The console logs can be found under developer tools. These logs help you determine the potential problem.

## <a name="event-log-entries"></a>Event log entries
If success auditing is enabled, then every time a user sign in with single sign-on an entry is recorded in the event log of the domain controller. To find these events, you can review the Event logs for the security Event 4769 associated with computer account **AzureADSSOAcc$**. The filter below finds all security events associated with the computer account:

```
    <QueryList>
      <Query Id="0" Path="Security">
    <Select Path="Security">*[EventData[Data[@Name='ServiceName'] and (Data='AZUREADSSOACC$')]]</Select>
      </Query>
    </QueryList>
```
