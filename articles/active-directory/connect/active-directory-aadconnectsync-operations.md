# <a name="azure-ad-connect-sync-operational-tasks-and-consideration"></a>Azure AD Connect sync: Operational tasks and consideration
The objective of this topic is to describe operational tasks for Azure AD Connect sync.

## <a name="staging-mode"></a>Staging mode
Staging mode can be used for several scenarios, including:

* High availability.
* Test and deploy new configuration changes.
* Introduce a new server and decommission the old.

With a server in staging mode, you can make changes to the configuration and preview the changes before you make the server active. It also allows you to run full import and full synchronization to verify that all changes are expected before you make these changes into your production environment.

During installation, you can select the server to be in **staging mode**. This action makes the server active for import and synchronization, but it does not run any exports. A server in staging mode is not running password sync or password writeback, even if you selected these features during installation. When you disable staging mode, the server starts exporting, enables password sync, and enables password writeback.

You can still force an export by using the synchronization service manager.

A server in staging mode continues to receive changes from Active Directory and Azure AD. It always has a copy of the latest changes and can very fast take over the responsibilities of another server. If you make configuration changes to your primary server, it is your responsibility to make the same changes to the server in staging mode.

For those of you with knowledge of older sync technologies, the staging mode is different since the server has its own SQL database. This architecture allows the staging mode server to be located in a different datacenter.

### <a name="verify-the-configuration-of-a-server"></a>Verify the configuration of a server
To apply this method, follow these steps:

1. [Prepare](#prepare)
2. [Configuration](#configuration)
3. [Import and Synchronize](#import-and-synchronize)
4. [Verify](#verify)
5. [Switch active server](#switch-active-server)

#### <a name="prepare"></a>Prepare
1. Install Azure AD Connect, select **staging mode**, and unselect **start synchronization** on the last page in the installation wizard. This mode allows you to run the sync engine manually.
   ![ReadyToConfigure](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations/readytoconfigure.png)
2. Sign off/sign in and from the start menu select **Synchronization Service**.

#### <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration
If you have made custom changes to the primary server and want to compare the configuration with the staging server, then use [Azure AD Connect configuration documenter](https://github.com/Microsoft/AADConnectConfigDocumenter).

#### <a name="import-and-synchronize"></a>Import and Synchronize
1. Select **Connectors**, and select the first Connector with the type **Active Directory Domain Services**. Click **Run**, select **Full import**, and **OK**. Do these steps for all Connectors of this type.
2. Select the Connector with type **Azure Active Directory (Microsoft)**. Click **Run**, select **Full import**, and **OK**.
3. Make sure the tab Connectors is still selected. For each Connector with type **Active Directory Domain Services**, click **Run**, select **Delta Synchronization**, and **OK**.
4. Select the Connector with type **Azure Active Directory (Microsoft)**. Click **Run**, select **Delta Synchronization**, and **OK**.

You have now staged export changes to Azure AD and on-premises AD (if you are using Exchange hybrid deployment). The next steps allow you to inspect what is about to change before you actually start the export to the directories.

#### <a name="verify"></a>Verify
1. Start a cmd prompt and go to `%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\bin`
2. Run: `csexport "Name of Connector" %temp%\export.xml /f:x` The name of the Connector can be found in Synchronization Service. It has a name similar to "contoso.com – AAD" for Azure AD.
3. Copy the PowerShell script from the section [CSAnalyzer](#appendix-csanalyzer) to a file named `csanalyzer.ps1`.
4. Open a PowerShell window and browse to the folder where you created the PowerShell script.
5. Run: `.\csanalyzer.ps1 -xmltoimport %temp%\export.xml`.
6. You now have a file named **processedusers1.csv** that can be examined in Microsoft Excel. All changes staged to be exported to Azure AD are found in this file.
7. Make necessary changes to the data or configuration and run these steps again (Import and Synchronize and Verify) until the changes that are about to be exported are expected.

#### <a name="switch-active-server"></a>Switch active server
1. On the currently active server, either turn off the server (DirSync/FIM/Azure AD Sync) so it is not exporting to Azure AD or set it in staging mode (Azure AD Connect).
2. Run the installation wizard on the server in **staging mode** and disable **staging mode**.

## <a name="disaster-recovery"></a>Disaster recovery
Part of the implementation design is to plan for what to do in case there is a disaster where you lose the sync server. There are different models to use and which one to use depends on several factors including:

* What is your tolerance for not being able make changes to objects in Azure AD during the downtime?
* If you use password synchronization, do the users accept that they have to use the old password in Azure AD in case they change it on-premises?
* Do you have a dependency on real-time operations, such as password writeback?

Depending on the answers to these questions and your organization’s policy, one of the following strategies can be implemented:

* Rebuild when needed.
* Have a spare standby server, known as **staging mode**.
* Use virtual machines.

If you do not use the built-in SQL Express database, then you should also review the [SQL High Availability](#sql-high-availability) section.

### <a name="rebuild-when-needed"></a>Rebuild when needed
A viable strategy is to plan for a server rebuild when needed. Usually, installing the sync engine and do the initial import and sync can be completed within a few hours. If there isn’t a spare server available, it is possible to temporarily use a domain controller to host the sync engine.

The sync engine server does not store any state about the objects so the database can be rebuilt from the data in Active Directory and Azure AD. The **sourceAnchor** attribute is used to join the objects from on-premises and the cloud. If you rebuild the server with existing objects on-premises and the cloud, then the sync engine matches those objects together again on reinstallation. The things you need to document and save are the configuration changes made to the server, such as filtering and synchronization rules. These custom configurations must be reapplied before you start synchronizing.

### <a name="have-a-spare-standby-server---staging-mode"></a>Have a spare standby server - staging mode
If you have a more complex environment, then having one or more standby servers is recommended. During installation, you can enable a server to be in **staging mode**.

For more information, see [staging mode](#staging-mode).

### <a name="use-virtual-machines"></a>Use virtual machines
A common and supported method is to run the sync engine in a virtual machine. In case the host has an issue, the image with the sync engine server can be migrated to another server.

### <a name="sql-high-availability"></a>SQL High Availability
If you are not using the SQL Server Express that comes with Azure AD Connect, then high availability for SQL Server should also be considered. The only high availability solution supported is SQL clustering. Unsupported solutions include mirroring and Always On.
