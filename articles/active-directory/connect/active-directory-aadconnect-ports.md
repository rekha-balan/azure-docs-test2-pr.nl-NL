# <a name="hybrid-identity-required-ports-and-protocols"></a>Hybrid Identity Required Ports and Protocols
The following document is a technical reference on the required ports and protocols for implementing a hybrid identity solution. Use the following illustration and refer to the corresponding table.

![What is Azure AD Connect](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/connect/media/active-directory-aadconnect-ports/required3.png)

## <a name="table-1---azure-ad-connect-and-on-premises-ad"></a>Table 1 - Azure AD Connect and On-premises AD
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Azure AD Connect server and on-premises AD.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNS |53 (TCP/UDP) |DNS lookups on the destination forest. |
| Kerberos |88 (TCP/UDP) |Kerberos authentication to the AD forest. |
| MS-RPC |135 (TCP/UDP) |Used during the initial configuration of the Azure AD Connect wizard when it binds to the AD forest, and also during Password synchronization. |
| LDAP |389 (TCP/UDP) |Used for data import from AD. Data is encrypted with Kerberos Sign & Seal. |
| LDAP/SSL |636 (TCP/UDP) |Used for data import from AD. The data transfer is signed and encrypted. Only used if you are using SSL. |
| RPC |49152- 65535 (Random high RPC Port)(TCP/UDP) |Used during the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect when it binds to the AD forests, and during Password synchronization. See [KB929851](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929851), [KB832017](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832017), and [KB224196](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/224196) for more information. |

## <a name="table-2---azure-ad-connect-and-azure-ad"></a>Table 2 - Azure AD Connect and Azure AD
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Azure AD Connect server and Azure AD.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP |80 (TCP/UDP) |Used to download CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) to verify SSL certificates. |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used to synchronize with Azure AD. |

For a list of URLs and IP addresses you need to open in your firewall, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).

## <a name="table-3---azure-ad-connect-and-ad-fs-federation-serverswap"></a>Table 3 - Azure AD Connect and AD FS Federation Servers/WAP
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Azure AD Connect server and AD FS Federation/WAP servers.  

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP |80 (TCP/UDP) |Used to download CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) to verify SSL certificates. |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used to synchronize with Azure AD. |
| WinRM |5985 |WinRM Listener |

## <a name="table-4---wap-and-federation-servers"></a>Table 4 - WAP and Federation Servers
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Federation servers and WAP servers.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used for authentication. |

## <a name="table-5---wap-and-users"></a>Table 5 - WAP and Users
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between users and the WAP servers.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used for device authentication. |
| TCP |49443 (TCP) |Used for certificate authentication. |

## <a name="table-6a--6b---pass-through-authentication-with-single-sign-on-sso-and-password-hash-sync-with-single-sign-on-sso"></a>Table 6a & 6b - Pass-through Authentication with Single Sign On (SSO) and Password Hash Sync with Single Sign On (SSO)
