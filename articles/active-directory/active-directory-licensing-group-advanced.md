# <a name="scenarios-limitations-and-known-issues-with-using-groups-to-manage-licensing-in-azure-active-directory"></a>Scenarios, limitations, and known issues with using groups to manage licensing in Azure Active Directory

Use the following information and examples to gain a more advanced understanding of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group-based licensing.

## <a name="use-group-based-licensing-with-dynamic-groups"></a>Use group-based licensing with dynamic groups

You can use group-based licensing with any security group, which means it can be combined with Azure AD dynamic groups. Dynamic groups run rules against user object attributes to automatically add and remove users from groups.

For example, you could create multiple dynamic groups, one per each set of products you want to assign to users. Each group contains a rule looking at a specific attribute on a user, describing which set of licenses they should receive. You can assign the attribute on-premises and sync it with Azure AD, or you can manage the attribute directly in the cloud.

When you specify the attribute, the user is added to one or more of these dynamic licensing groups. Licenses are assigned to the user shortly after that. When the attribute is removed, the user leaves the groups and the licenses are removed.

### <a name="example"></a>Example

Consider an on-premises identity management solution that decides which users should have access to what Microsoft web services. It uses **extensionAttribute1** to store a string value representing the licenses the user should have. Azure AD Connect syncs it with Azure AD.

For this example, the goal is to distribute Office 365 Enterprise E5 and Enterprise Mobility + Security licenses to users. In Azure AD, create two dynamic groups, one for each product. This is because some users may need one of the products, but not the other. Then specify the dynamic membership rule and license settings on each group. Here's what they look like:

#### <a name="office-365-enterprise-e5-base-services"></a>Office 365 Enterprise E5: base services

![Screenshot of Office 365 Enterprise E5 base services](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/o365-e5-base-services.png)

#### <a name="enterprise-mobility--security-licensed-users"></a>Enterprise Mobility + Security: licensed users

![Screenshot of Enterprise Mobility + Security licensed users](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/o365-e5-licensed-users.png)

For this example, modify one user and set their extensionAttribute1 to the value of `EMS;E5_baseservices;`. This is because you want this user to have both licenses. Note that you can make this modification on-premises. After the change syncs with the cloud, the user is automatically added to both groups, and licenses are assigned.

### <a name="modify-a-dynamic-group-membership-rule"></a>Modify a dynamic group membership rule

Use caution when modifying an existing group’s membership rule. When a rule is changed, all users are removed from the group. The rule is evaluated, and then users are added to the group based on the new conditions.

If the group has licenses assigned, all users have those licenses removed during the process. New licenses are applied only after the new rule is evaluated and users are added back. This means that users might experience loss of service, or in some cases, loss of data.

It's better not to change the membership rule on a group used for license assignment. Instead, create a new group with the new rule and specify the same license settings as on the original group. Wait until members have been added and licenses have been applied to all users. Only then can you delete the original group. This approach ensures a safe, staged transition to the new membership rule, without any loss of access or data for users.


## <a name="multiple-groups-and-multiple-licenses"></a>Multiple groups and multiple licenses

A user can be a member of multiple groups with licenses. Here are some things to consider:

- Multiple licenses for the same product can overlap, and result in all of the enabled services being applied to the user. The following example shows two licensing groups: *E3 base services* contains the foundation services to deploy first, to all users. And *E3 extended services* contains additional services (Sway and Planner) to deploy only to some users. Note that Yammer remains disabled for future deployment. In this example, the user was added to both groups:

  ![Screenshot of enabled services](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/view-enabled-services.png)

  As a result, the user has 7 of the 12 services in the product enabled, while using only one license for this product.

- Selecting the *E3* license shows more details, including information about which groups caused what services to be enabled for the user.

  ![Screenshot of enabled services by group](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/view-enabled-service-by-group.png)

## <a name="direct-licenses-coexist-with-group-licenses"></a>Direct licenses coexist with group licenses

When a user inherits a license from a group, it is not possible to remove or modify that license assignment directly on the user object. Instead, any changes must be made in the group and then propagated by the system to all users.

It is possible, however, to assign the same product license directly to the user, in addition to the inherited license. This may be used, for example, to enable additional services from the product just for one user, without affecting other users.

Directly assigned licenses can be removed, but that won’t affect the inherited license. For example, consider the following user, who inherits an Office 365 Enterprise E3 license from a group.

1. Initially, the user inherits the license only from the *E3 basic services* group. This enables 4 service plans, as shown in the following image.

  ![Screenshot of E3 group enabled services](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/e3-group-enabled-services.png)

2. By clicking **Assign**, you can directly assign an E3 license to the user. In this case, you are going to disable all service plans except Yammer Enterprise.

  ![Screenshot of how to assign a license directly to a user](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/assign-license-to-user.png)

3. As a result, the user still uses only one license of the E3 product. But the direct assignment enables the Yammer Enterprise service for that user only. The following image shows which services are enabled by the group membership versus the direct assignment.

  ![Screenshot of inherited versus direct assignment](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/direct-vs-inherited-assignment.png)

4. When you use direct assignment, the following operations are allowed:

  a. Yammer Enterprise can be turned off on the user object directly. Notice that the **On/Off** toggle is enabled for this service, as opposed to the other service toggles. This is because this service is enabled directly on the user, and thus can be modified.

  b. Additional services can be enabled as well, as part of the directly assigned license.

  c. The **Remove** button can be used to remove the direct license from the user. You can see that the user now only has the inherited group license and only the original services remain enabled.

    ![Screenshot showing how to remove direct assignment](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/remove-direct-license.png)

## <a name="usage-location"></a>Usage location

Some Microsoft services are not available in all locations. Before a license can be assigned to a user, the administrator has to specify the **Usage location** property on the user. This can be done in [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), under **User** &gt; **Profile** &gt; **Settings**.

For group license assignment, any users without a usage location specified inherit the location of the directory. If you have users in different locations, make sure to reflect that correctly in your user objects before adding users to groups with licenses.

## <a name="use-powershell-to-see-who-has-inherited-and-direct-licenses"></a>Use PowerShell to see who has inherited and direct licenses

During the preview period of an Azure AD release, PowerShell cannot be used to fully control group license assignments. However, it can be used to discover basic information about user state, and to determine if licenses are inherited from a group or assigned directly. The following code sample shows how an admin can produce a basic report about license assignments.

1. Run the `connect-msolservice` cmdlet to authenticate and connect to your tenant.

2. `Get-MsolAccountSku` can be used to discover all provisioned product licenses in the tenant.

  ![Screenshot of the Get-Msolaccountsku cmdlet](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/get-msolaccountsku-cmdlet.png)

3. In this example, you want to find out which users have the Enterprise Mobility + Security license assigned directly, from a group, or both. You can use the following PowerShell script.
  
  ```
  #Returns TRUE if the user has the license assigned directly
  function UserHasLicenseAssignedDirectly
  {
      Param([Microsoft.Online.Administration.User]$user, [string]$skuId)
      foreach($license in $user.Licenses)
      {
          #we look for the specific license SKU in all licenses assigned to the user
          if ($license.AccountSkuId -ieq $skuId)
          {
              #GroupsAssigningLicense contains a collection of IDs of objects assigning the license
              #This could be a group object or a user object (contrary to what the name suggests)
              #If the collection is empty, this means the license is assigned directly. This is the case for users who have never been licensed via groups in the past
              if ($license.GroupsAssigningLicense.Count -eq 0)
              {
                  return $true
              }
              #If the collection contains the ID of the user object, this means the license is assigned directly
              #Note: the license may also be assigned through one or more groups in addition to being assigned directly
              foreach ($assignmentSource in $license.GroupsAssigningLicense)
              {
                  if ($assignmentSource -ieq $user.ObjectId)
                  {
                      return $true
                  }
              }
              return $false
          }
      }
      return $false
  }
  #Returns TRUE if the user is inheriting the license from a group
  function UserHasLicenseAssignedFromGroup
  {
    Param([Microsoft.Online.Administration.User]$user, [string]$skuId)
     foreach($license in $user.Licenses
     {
        #we look for the specific license SKU in all licenses assigned to the user
        if ($license.AccountSkuId -ieq $skuId)
        {
          #GroupsAssigningLicense contains a collection of IDs of objects assigning the license
          #This could be a group object or a user object (contrary to what the name suggests)
            foreach ($assignmentSource in $license.GroupsAssigningLicense)
          {
                  #If the collection contains at least one ID not matching the user ID this means that the license is inherited from a group.
                  #Note: the license may also be assigned directly in addition to being inherited
                  if ($assignmentSource -ine $user.ObjectId)

            {
                      return $true
            }
          }
              return $false
        }
      }
      return $false
  }
  ```

4. The rest of the script gets all users, and runs these functions on each user. Then it formats the output into a table.
    
  ```
  #the license SKU we are interested in
  $skuId = "reseller-account:EMS"
  #find all users that have the SKU license assigned
  Get-MsolUser -All | where {$_.isLicensed -eq $true -and $_.Licenses.AccountSKUID -eq $skuId} | select `
      ObjectId, `
      @{Name="SkuId";Expression={$skuId}}, `
      @{Name="AssignedDirectly";Expression={(UserHasLicenseAssignedDirectly $_ $skuId)}}, `
      @{Name="AssignedFromGroup";Expression={(UserHasLicenseAssignedFromGroup $_ $skuId)}}
  ```

5. The output of the complete script appears as the following:

  ![Screenshot of PowerShell script output](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced/powershell-script-output.png)

## <a name="limitations-and-known-issues"></a>Limitations and known issues

If you use group-based licensing, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the following list of limitations and known issues.

- Group-based licensing currently does not support “nested groups” (groups that contain other groups). If you apply a license to a nested group, only the immediate first-level user members of the group have the licenses applied.

- One or more of the licenses could not be modified because they are inherited from a group membership. To view or modify group based licenses visit the Azure admin portal.

- The [Office 365 admin portal](https://portal.office.com ) does not currently support group-based licensing. If a user inherits a license from a group, this license appears in the Office admin portal as a regular user license. If you try to modify that license (for example, to disable a service in the license), or try to remove the license, the portal returns an error message. Inherited group licenses cannot be modified directly on a user.

- When a user is removed from a group and loses the license, the service plans from that license (for example, Exchange Online or SharePoint Online) are set to a “suspended” state. The service plans are not set to a final, disabled state. This is a precaution to avoid accidental removal of user data, if an admin makes a mistake in group membership management.

- When licenses are assigned or modified for an extremely large group (for example, 100,000 users), this could impact performance. Specifically, the volume of changes generated by Azure AD automation might negatively impact the performance of your directory synchronization between Azure AD and on-premises systems. This could cause delays in directory sync in your environment.

- License management automation does not automatically react to all types of changes in the environment. For example, you might have run out of licenses, causing some users to be in an error state. To free up the available seat count, you can remove some directly assigned licenses from other users. However, the system does not automatically react to this change and fix users in that error state.

  As a workaround to these types of limitations, you can go to the **Group** blade in Azure AD, and click **Reprocess**. This processes all users in that group and resolves the error states, if possible.
