> If you plan to configure your custom domain name to be used with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) or a different security token service (STS) on your corporate network, follow the instructions in [Add and configure a domain for federation with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-add-domain-federated.md). This is useful if you plan to synchronize users from your corporate directory to Azure AD, and [password hash sync](active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization.md) does not meet your requirements.
