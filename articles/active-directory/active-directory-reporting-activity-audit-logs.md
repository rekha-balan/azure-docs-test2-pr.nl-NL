# <a name="audit-activity-reports-in-the-azure-active-directory-portal---preview"></a>Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal - preview

With reporting in the Azure Active Directory [preview](active-directory-preview-explainer.md), you get all the information you need to determine how your environment is doing.

The reporting architecture in Azure Active Directory consists of the following components:

- **Activity** 
    - **Sign-in activities** â€“ Information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities
    - **Audit logs** - System activity information about users and group management, your managed applications and directory activities.
- **Security** 
    - **Risky sign-ins** - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account. For more details, see Risky sign-ins.
    - **Users flagged for risk** - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised. For more details, see Users flagged for risk.

This topic gives you an overview of the audit activities.
 


## <a name="audit-logs"></a>Audit logs

The audit logs in Azure Active Directory provide records of system activities for compliance.  
Your first entry point to all auditing data is **Audit logs** in the **Activity** section of **Azure Active Directory**.

![Audit logs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-reporting-activity-audit-logs/61.png "Audit logs")

An audit log has a default list view that shows:

- the date and time of the occurrence
- the initiator / actor (*who*) of an activity 
- the activity (*what*) 
- the target

![Audit logs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-reporting-activity-audit-logs/18.png "Audit logs")

You can customize the list view by clicking **Columns** in the toolbar.

![Audit logs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-reporting-activity-audit-logs/19.png "Audit logs")

This enables you to display additional fields or remove fields that are already displayed.

![Audit logs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-reporting-activity-audit-logs/21.png "Audit logs")


By clicking an item in the list view, you get all available details about it.

## <a name="filtering-audit-logs"></a>Filtering audit logs

To narrow down the reported data to a level that works for you, you can filter the audit data using the following fields:

- Date range
- Initiated by (Actor)
- Category
- Activity resource type
- Activity

![Audit logs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-reporting-activity-audit-logs/23.png "Audit logs")


The **date range** filter enables to you to define a timeframe for the returned data.  
Possible values are:

- 1 month
- 7 days
- 24 hours
- Custom

When you select a custom timeframe, you can configure a start time and an end time.

The **initiated by** filter enables you to define an actor's name or its universal principal name (UPN).

The **category** filter enables you to select one of the following filter:

- All
- Core category
- Core directory
- Self-service password management
- Self-service group management
- Account provisioning
- Automated password rollover
- invited users
- MIM service

The **activity resource type** filter enables you to select one of the following filters:

- All 
- Group
- Directory
- User
- Application
- Policy
- Device
- Other

When you select **Group** as **activity resource type**, you get an additional filter category that enables you to also provide a **Source**:

- Azure AD
- O365




The **activity** filter is based on the category and Activity resource type selection you make. You can select a specific activity you want to see or choose all.

## <a name="audit-logs-shortcuts"></a>Audit logs shortcuts

In addition to **Azure Active Directory**, the Azure portal provides you with two additional entry points to audit data:

- Users and groups
- Enterprise applications

For a complete list of audit report activities, see the [list of audit report events](active-directory-reporting-audit-events.md#list-of-audit-report-events).


### <a name="users-and-groups-audit-logs"></a>Users and groups audit logs

With user and group-based audit reports, you can get answers to questions such as:

- What types of updates have been applied the users?

- How many users were changed?

- How many passwords were changed?

- What has an administrator done in a directory?

- What are the groups that have been added?

- Are there groups with membership changes?

- Have the owners of group been changed?

- What licenses have been assigned to a group or a user?

If you just want to review auditing data that is related to users and groups, you can find a filtered view under **Audit logs** in the **Activity** section of the **Users and Groups**. This entry point has **Users and groups** as preselected **Activity Resource Type**.

![Audit logs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-reporting-activity-audit-logs/93.png "Audit logs")

### <a name="enterprise-applications-audit-logs"></a>Enterprise applications audit logs

With application-based audit reports, you can get answers to questions such as:

* What are the applications that have been added or updated?
* What are the applications that have been removed?
* Has a service principle for an application changed?
* Have the names of applications been changed?
* Who gave consent to an application?

If you just want to review auditing data that is related to your applications, you can find a filtered view under **Audit logs** in the **Activity** section of the **Enterprise applications** blade. This entry point has **Enterprise applications** as preselected **Activity Resource Type**.

![Audit logs](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-reporting-activity-audit-logs/134.png "Audit logs")

You can filter this view further down to just **groups** or just **users**.
