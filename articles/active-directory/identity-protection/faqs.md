# <a name="azure-active-directory-identity-protection-faq"></a>Azure Active Directory Identity Protection FAQ

This article includes answers to frequently asked questions about Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Protection. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](../active-directory-identityprotection.md). 


## <a name="why-do-some-risk-events-have-closed-system-status"></a>Why do some risk events have “Closed (system)” status?

**A:** These risk events were detected by Identity Protection and later closed because the events were no longer considered risky. These events do not count towards the user’s risk level.

**A:** No. You can either be a Security Reader, a Security Admin or a Global Admin to use Identity Protection.

## <a name="how-do-i-get-identity-protection"></a>How do I get Identity Protection?

**A:** See [Getting started with Azure Active Directory Premium](../fundamentals/active-directory-get-started-premium.md) for an answer to this question.

## <a name="how-can-i-sort-users-in-users-flagged-for-risk"></a>How can I sort users in "Users flagged for risk"?

**A:** Download the users flagged for risk report by clicking **Download** on the top of the **Users flagged for risk** page. You can then sort the downloaded data based on available fields, including Last Updated (UTC).
