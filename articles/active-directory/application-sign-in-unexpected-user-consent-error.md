# <a name="unexpected-error-when-performing-consent-to-an-application"></a>Unexpected error when performing consent to an application

This article discusses errors that can occur during the process of consenting to an application. If you are Troubleshoot unexpected consent prompts that do not contain any error messages, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios).

Many applications that integrate with Azure Active Directory require permissions to access other resources in order to function. When these resources are also integrated with Azure Active Directory, permissions to access them is often requested using the common consent framework. 

This results in a consent prompt being displayed, which generally occurs the first time an application is used but can also occur on a subsequent use of the application.

Certain conditions must be true for a user to consent to the permissions an application requires. If these conditions are not met, various errors can occur. These include:

## <a name="requesting-not-authorized-permissions-error"></a>Requesting not authorized permissions error
* **AADSTS90093:** &lt;clientAppDisplayName&gt; is requesting one or more permissions that you are not authorized to grant. Contact an administrator, who can consent to this application on your behalf.

This error occurs when a user who is not a company administrator attempts to use an application that is requesting permissions that only an administrator can grant. This error can be resolved by an administrator granting access to the application on behalf of their organization.

## <a name="policy-prevents-granting-permissions-error"></a>Policy prevents granting permissions error
* **AADSTS90093:** An administrator of &lt;tenantDisplayName&gt; has set a policy that prevents you from granting &lt;name of app&gt; the permissions it is requesting. Contact an administrator of &lt;tenantDisplayName&gt;, who can grant permissions to this app on your behalf.

This error occurs when a company administrator turns off the ability for users to consent to applications, then a non-administrator user attempts to use an application that requires consent. This error can be resolved by an administrator granting access to the application on behalf of their organization.

## <a name="intermittent-problem-error"></a>Intermittent problem error
* **AADSTS90090:** It looks like we encountered an intermittent problem recording the permissions you attempted to grant to &lt;clientAppDisplayName&gt;. try again later.

This error indicates that an intermittent service side issue has occurred. It can be resolved by attempting to consent to the application again.

## <a name="resource-not-available-error"></a>Resource not available error
* **AADSTS65005:** The app &lt;clientAppDisplayName&gt; requested permissions to access a resource &lt;resourceAppDisplayName&gt; that is not available. 

Contact the application developer.

##  <a name="resource-not-available-in-tenant-error"></a>Resource not available in tenant error
* **AADSTS65005:** &lt;clientAppDisplayName&gt; is requesting access to a resource &lt;resourceAppDisplayName&gt; that is not available in your organization &lt;tenantDisplayName&gt;. 

Ensure that this resource is available or contact an administrator of &lt;tenantDisplayName&gt;.

## <a name="permissions-mismatch-error"></a>Permissions mismatch error
* **AADSTS65005:** The app requested consent to access resource &lt;resourceAppDisplayName&gt;. This request failed because it does not match how the app was pre-configured during app registration. Contact the app vendor.**

These errors all occur when the application a user is trying to consent to is requesting permissions to access a resource application that cannot be found in the organizationâ€™s directory (tenant). This can occur for several reasons:

-   The client application developer has configured their application incorrectly, causing it to request access to an invalid resource. In this case, the application developer must update the configuration of the client application to resolve this issue.

-   A Service Principal representing the target resource application does not exist in the organization, or existed in the past but has been removed. To resolve this issue, a Service Principal for the resource application must be provisioned in the organization so the client application can request permissions to it. This can happen in an number of ways, depending on the type of application, including:

    -   Acquiring a subscription for the resource application (Microsoft published applications)

    -   Consenting to the resource application

    -   Granting the application permissions via the Azure Portal

    -   Adding the application from the Azure AD Application Gallery
