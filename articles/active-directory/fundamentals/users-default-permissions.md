<!-- ### Enterprise application owner permissions

When a user adds a new enterprise application, they are automatically added as an owner for the tenant-specific configuration of the application. As an owner, they can manage the tenant-specific configuration of the application, such as the SSO configuration, provisioning, and user assignments. An owner can also add or remove other owners. Unlike Global Administrators, owners can manage only the applications they own. <!--To assign an enterprise application owner, see *Assigning Owners for an Application*.-->
