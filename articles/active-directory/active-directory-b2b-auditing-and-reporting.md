![audit log](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-b2b-auditing-and-reporting/audit-log.png)

![activity details](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory/media/active-directory-b2b-auditing-and-reporting/activity-details.png)

You can also export these logs from Azure AD and use the reporting tool of your choice to get customized reports.
