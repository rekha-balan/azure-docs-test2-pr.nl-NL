# <a name="provide-security-contact-details-in-azure-security-center"></a>Provide security contact details in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center will recommend that you provide security contact details for your Azure subscription if you havenâ€™t already. This information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your customer data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. MSRC performs select security monitoring of the Azure network and infrastructure and receives threat intelligence and abuse complaints from third parties.

An email notification is sent on the first daily occurrence of an alert and only for high severity alerts. Email preferences can only be configured for subscription policies. Resource groups within a subscription will inherit these settings.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.
