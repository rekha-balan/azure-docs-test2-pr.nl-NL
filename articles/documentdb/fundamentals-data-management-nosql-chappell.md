# <a name="understanding-nosql-on-microsoft-azure"></a>Understanding NoSQL on Microsoft Azure
Are you curious about the array of NoSQL technologies available in Azure, but aren't sure how they differ from each other or the relational models available? Or maybe you've got specific data in mind, but aren't sure which NoSQL technology is best for your application. 

If so, we have two resources available to you: 

* [NoSQL vs SQL](documentdb-nosql-vs-sql.md) article. This article discusses the differences between NoSQL and SQL, and provide you with an introduction to the NoSQL and SQL offerings from Microsoft.
* [Understanding NoSQL on Microsoft Azure](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=330292) whitepaper by David Chappell. This whitepaper walks you through the following:
  
  * Differentiating operational data, which is read and written by applications, from analytical data, which is used to provide business intelligence (BI), to help determine the right technology for your needs.
  * A quick review of relational technology.
  * An introduction to each of the Azure NoSQL technologies: DocumentDB, Table storage, HBase, and HDInsight.
  * A comparison of the NoSQL technologies and Azure SQL Database. 
  * When to use Azure DocumentDB vs. Table storage vs. HBase vs. HDInsight vs. SQL Database.
