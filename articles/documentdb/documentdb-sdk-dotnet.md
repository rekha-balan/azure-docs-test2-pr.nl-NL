### <a name="a-name194194"></a><a name="1.9.4"/>1.9.4
* Modified the ResourceResponse, FeedResponse, StoredProcedureResponse and MediaResponse classes to implement the corresponding public interface so that they can be mocked for test driven deployment (TDD).

* Fixed the ability to use parameters of different types when using user-defined functions in LINQ. 
* Fixed a bug for globally replicated accounts where Upsert calls were being directed to read locations instead of write locations.
* Added methods to the IDocumentClient interface that were missing: 
  * UpsertAttachmentAsync method that takes mediaStream and options as parameters

* Added configuration option to set the ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit for a given DocumentDB endpoint Uri.  Use ConnectionPolicy.MaxConnectionLimit to change the default value, which is set to 50.
* Deprecated IPartitionResolver and its implementation.  Support for IPartitionResolver is now obsolete. It's recommended that you use Partitioned Collections for higher storage and throughput.

## <a name="release--retirement-dates"></a>Release & Retirement dates
Microsoft will provide notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version.

New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK, as such it is recommended that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible. 

Any request to DocumentDB using a retired SDK will be rejected by the service.
