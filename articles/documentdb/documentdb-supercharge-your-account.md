# <a name="migrate-your-documentdb-s1-s2-or-s3-account"></a>Migrate your DocumentDB S1, S2, or S3 account
Follow these steps to take advantage of increased throughput for your Azure DocumentDB account by moving to the Standard pricing tier. With little to no additional cost, you can increase the throughput of your existing S1 account from 250 [RU/s](documentdb-request-units.md) to 400 RU/s, or more! All Standard accounts benefit from the ability to scale throughput to meet the needs of your applications. You no longer need to choose from predefined throughput options, you can scale whenever you need to achieve the throughput your application requires.

1. In your browser, navigate to the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com). 
2. On the left menu, click **NoSQL (DocumentDB)**, or click **More Services**, scroll to **Databases**, and then select **NoSQL (DocumentDB)**.   
3. In the **NoSQL (DocumentDB)** blade, select the account to modify.
4. In the new blade, in the menu under **Collections**, click **Scale**.

5. As shown in the screenshot above, do the following: 

 - In the new blade, use the drop-down menu to select the collection with the S1, S2, or S3 pricing tier. 
 - Click **Pricing Tier S1**, **S2**, or **S3**.
 - In the **Choose your pricing tier** blade, click **Standard**, and then click **Select** to save your change.
   
6. Back in the **Scale** blade, the **Throughput (RU/s)** box is displayed with a default value of 400 and the  the **Pricing Tier** is changed to **Standard**.  You can change the throughput to whatever value your application requires. We recommend using the [DocumentDB capacity planner](https://www.documentdb.com/capacityplanner) to determine how many [Request units](documentdb-request-units.md)/second (RU/s) your application needs. The **Estimated monthly bill** area at the bottom of the page updates automatically to provide an estimate of the monthly cost. Click **Save** to save your changes.

7. The collection is scaled to meet the new requirements, and a success message is displayed.
