## <a name="create-a-wechat-application"></a>Create a WeChat application

To use WeChat as an identity provider in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, you need to create a WeChat application and supply it with the right parameters. You need a WeChat account to do this. If you don’t have one, you can get one by signing up through one of their mobile apps or by using your QQ number. After that, get your account registered with the WeChat developer program. You can find more information [here](http://kf.qq.com/faq/161220Brem2Q161220uUjERB.html).

### <a name="register-a-wechat-application"></a>Register a WeChat application

1. Go to [https://open.weixin.qq.com/](https://open.weixin.qq.com/) and log in.
2. Click on **管理中心** (management center).
3. Follow the necessary steps to register a new application.
4. For **授权回调域** (callback URL), enter `https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/{tenant_name}/oauth2/authresp`. For example, if your `tenant_name` is contoso.onmicrosoft.com, set the URL to be `https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`.
5. Find and copy the **APP ID** and **APP KEY**. You will need these later.
