# <a name="set-up-sign-up-and-sign-in-with-a-google-account-using-azure-active-directory-b2c"></a>Set up sign-up and sign-in with a Google account using Azure Active Directory B2C

## <a name="create-a-google-application"></a>Create a Google application

To use a Google account as an identity provider in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, you need to create an application in your tenant that represents it. If you donâ€™t already have a Google account you can get it at [https://accounts.google.com/SignUp](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).

1. Sign in to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) with your Google account credentials.
2. Select **Create project**, and then click **Create**. If you have created projects before, select the project list, and then select **New Project**.
3. Enter a **Project name**, and then click **Create**.
3. Select **Credentials** in the left menu, and then select **Create credentials** > **Oauth client ID**.
4. Select **Configure consent screen**.
5. Select or specify a valid **Email address**, provide a **Product name shown to users**, and click **Save**.
6. Under **Application type**, select **Web application**.
7. Enter a **Name** for your application, enter `https://{tenant}.b2clogin.com` in **Authorized JavaScript origins**, and `https://{tenant}.b2clogin.com/te/{tenant}.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp` in **Authorized redirect URIs**. Replace **{tenant}** with your tenant's name (for example, contosob2c).
8. Click **Create**.
9. Copy the values of **Client ID** and **Client secret**. You will need both of them to configure Google as an identity provider in your tenant. **Client secret** is an important security credential.
