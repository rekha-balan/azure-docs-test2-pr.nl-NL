## <a name="create-a-microsoft-account-application"></a>Create a Microsoft account application

To use a Microsoft account as an identity provider in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, you need to create an application in your tenant that represents it. If you donâ€™t already have a Microsoft account, you can get it at [https://www.live.com/](https://www.live.com/).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/?referrer=https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles&deeplink=/appList) with your Microsoft account credentials.
2. In the upper-right corner, select **Add an app**.
3. Provide a **Name** for your application and click **Create**.
4. On the registration page, copy the value of **Application Id**. You use it to configure your Microsoft account as an identity provider in your tenant.
5. Select **Add platform**, and then and choose **Web**.
6. Enter `https://{tenant}.b2clogin.com/te/{tenant}.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp` in **Redirect URLs**. Replace **{tenant}** with your tenant's name (for example, contosob2c).
7. Select **Generate New Password** under **Application Secrets**. Copy the new password displayed on screen. You need it to configure a Microsoft account as an identity provider in your tenant. This password is an important security credential.
