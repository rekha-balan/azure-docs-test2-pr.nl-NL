## <a name="clean-up"></a>Clean up
To completely delete an Azure Dev Spaces instance on a cluster, including all the dev spaces and running services within it, use the `az aks remove-dev-spaces` command. Bear in mind that this action is irreversible. You can add support for Azure Dev Spaces again on the cluster, but it will be as if you are starting again. Your old services and spaces won't be restored.

The following example lists the Azure Dev Spaces controllers in your active subscription, and then deletes the Azure Dev Spaces controller that is associated with AKS cluster 'myaks' in resource group 'myaks-rg'.

```cmd
    azds controller list
    az aks remove-dev-spaces --name myaks --resource-group myaks-rg
```
