# <a name="options-for-migrating-out-of-azure-remoteapp"></a>Options for migrating out of Azure RemoteApp
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure RemoteApp is being discontinued on August 31, 2017. Read the [announcement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=821148) for details.


If you have stopped using Azure RemoteApp because of the [retirement announcement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=821148) or because you've finished your evaluation, you need to migrate off of Azure RemoteApp to another app service. There are two different approaches for migrating: a self-managed (often called Infrastructure as a Service [IaaS]) deployment or a fully managed (often called Platform as a Service or Software as a Service [PaaS/SaaS]) offering. 

Self-service IaaS is a do-it-yourself deployment that is managed, operated, and owned by you, directly deployed on virtual machines (VMs) or physical systems. At the other end, a fully managed PaaS/SaaS offering is more like Azure RemoteApp - a partner provides a service layer on top of a remoting solution that handles operational and servicing, while you, as the customer, do some image and app management.

[View the Azure RemoteApp webinars on migration options](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/40557aaa-3e9f-403c-b221-ad3eac10dc56/migration-option-webinar-recordings?forum=AzureRemoteApp), or read on for more information (including examples of the different hosting options).

## <a name="self-managed-iaas-solutions"></a>Self-managed (IaaS) solutions
### <a name="rds-on-iaas"></a>**RDS on IaaS**
You can deploy a native session-based Remote Desktop Services (in Windows Server) deployment using either RemoteApp or desktops on-premises or in a hosted environment (like on Azure VMs). RDS on IaaS deployments are best for customers already familiar with and that have existing technical expertise with RDS deployments. 

> [!NOTE]
> You need Volume Licensing with Software Assurance (SA) for RDS client access licenses to use this deployment option.

Deploying RDS on Azure VMs is easier than ever when you use deployment and patching templates (read an [overview](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/07/13/azure-resource-manager-template-for-rds-deployment/) and then [go get them](https://aka.ms/rdautomation)). You can get the same elastic scaling capabilities with Azure classic deployment model resources (not Azure Resource Model resources) within Azure RemoteApp by using the [auto scaling script](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Automatic-Scaling-of-9b4f5e76), although there are more customizations and configurations. When you deploy RDS on Azure VMs, support is provided through [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/), the same support professionals that supported you with Azure RemoteApp. You can get cost estimates based on your existing usage by contacting [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/), or you can perform calculations yourself using a soon to be released Cost Calculator.  Also, with N-series VMs (currently in private preview) you can add vGPU - hear more about adding vGPU and about how to [harness RDS improvements in Windows Server 2016](https://myignite.microsoft.com/videos/2794) in our Ignite session.   

We have step by step deployment guides for [Windows Server 2012 R2](http://aka.ms/rdsonazure) and [Windows Server 2016](http://aka.ms/rdsonazure2016) to assist with your deployment. Check out the [Remote Desktop blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/?product=windows-server-remote-desktop-services) for the latest news.

### <a name="citrix-on-iaas"></a>**Citrix on IaaS**
A native Citrix deployment of session-based XenApp or XenDesktop can be deployed on-premises or within a hosted environment (such as on Azure VMs). 

Check out the step-by-step deployment guide, [Citrix XA 7.6 on Azure](http://www.citrixandmicrosoft.com/Documents/Citrix-Azure Deployment Guide-v.1.0.docx), for more information. Read more about [Citrix on Azure](http://www.citrixandmicrosoft.com/Solutions/AzureCloud.aspx), including a price calculator. You can also find a [Citrix contact](http://citrix.com/English/contact/index.asp) to discuss your options with.
