If you are deploying an Azure RemoteApp cloud or hybrid collection in a virtual network (VNET), review the following port information. For more information on virtual networks, read [Virtual Network Overview](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

For more information on network security groups, read [What is a Network Security Group? (NSG)](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md).
