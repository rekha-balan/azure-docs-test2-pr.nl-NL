# <a name="configure-secure-ldap-ldaps-for-an-azure-ad-domain-services-managed-domain"></a>Configure Secure LDAP (LDAPS) for an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain
This article shows how you can enable Secure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPS) for your Azure AD Domain Services managed domain. Secure LDAP is also known as 'Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS)'.

## <a name="before-you-begin"></a>Before you begin
To perform the tasks listed in this article, you need:

1. A valid **Azure subscription**.
2. An **Azure AD directory** - either synchronized with an on-premises directory or a cloud-only directory.
3. **Azure AD Domain Services** must be enabled for the Azure AD directory. If you haven't done so, follow all the tasks outlined in the [Getting Started guide](active-directory-ds-getting-started.md).
4. A **certificate to be used to enable secure LDAP**.

   * **Recommended** - Obtain a certificate from a trusted public certification authority. This configuration option is more secure.
   * Alternately, you may also choose to [create a self-signed certificate](#task-1---obtain-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap) as shown later in this article.

<br>

### <a name="requirements-for-the-secure-ldap-certificate"></a>Requirements for the secure LDAP certificate
Acquire a valid certificate per the following guidelines, before you enable secure LDAP. You encounter failures if you try to enable secure LDAP for your managed domain with an invalid/incorrect certificate.

1. **Trusted issuer** - The certificate must be issued by an authority trusted by computers that need to connect to the domain using secure LDAP. This authority may be a public certification authority trusted by these computers.
2. **Lifetime** - The certificate must be valid for at least the next 3-6 months. Secure LDAP access to your managed domain is disrupted when the certificate expires.
3. **Subject name** - The subject name on the certificate must be a wildcard for your managed domain. For instance, if your domain is named 'contoso100.com', the certificate's subject name must be '*.contoso100.com'. Set the DNS name (subject alternate name) to this wildcard name.
4. **Key usage** - The certificate must be configured for the following uses - Digital signatures and key encipherment.
5. **Certificate purpose** - The certificate must be valid for SSL server authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> **Enterprise Certification Authorities:** Azure AD Domain Services does not currently support using secure LDAP certificates issued by your organization's enterprise certification authority. This restriction is because the service does not trust your enterprise CA as a root certification authority. We expect to add support for enterprise CAs in the future. If you absolutely must use certificates issued by your enterprise CA, [contact us](active-directory-ds-contact-us.md) for assistance.

## <a name="task-1---obtain-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap"></a>Task 1 - Obtain a certificate for secure LDAP
The first task involves obtaining a certificate used for secure LDAP access to the managed domain. You have two options:

* Obtain a certificate from a certification authority. The authority may be a public certification authority.
* Create a self-signed certificate.

### <a name="option-a-recommended---obtain-a-secure-ldap-certificate-from-a-certification-authority"></a>Option A (Recommended) - Obtain a secure LDAP certificate from a certification authority
If your organization obtains its certificates from a public certification authority, you need to obtain the secure LDAP certificate from that public certification authority.

When requesting a certificate, ensure that you follow the requirements outlined in [Requirement for the secure LDAP certificate](#requirements-for-the-secure-ldap-certificate).

> [!NOTE]
> Client computers that need to connect to the managed domain using secure LDAP must trust the issuer of the secure LDAP certificate.
>
>

### <a name="option-b---create-a-self-signed-certificate-for-secure-ldap"></a>Option B - Create a self-signed certificate for secure LDAP
If you do not expect to use a certificate from a public certification authority, you may choose to create a self-signed certificate for secure LDAP.

**Create a self-signed certificate using PowerShell**

On your Windows computer, open a new PowerShell window as **Administrator** and type the following commands, to create a new self-signed certificate.

    $lifetime=Get-Date

    New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject *.contoso100.com -NotAfter $lifetime.AddDays(365) -KeyUsage DigitalSignature, KeyEncipherment -Type SSLServerAuthentication -DnsName *.contoso100.com

In the preceding sample, replace 'contoso100.com' with the DNS domain name of your Azure AD Domain Services managed domain.

![Select Azure AD Directory](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-powershell-create-self-signed-cert.png)

The newly created self-signed certificate is placed in the local machine's certificate store.

## <a name="task-2---export-the-secure-ldap-certificate-to-a-pfx-file"></a>Task 2 - Export the secure LDAP certificate to a .PFX file
Before you start this task, ensure that you have obtained the secure LDAP certificate from a public certification authority or have created a self-signed certificate.

Perform the following steps, to export the LDAPS certificate to a .PFX file.

1. Press the **Start** button and type **R**. In the **Run** dialog, type **mmc** and click **OK**.

## <a name="task-3---enable-secure-ldap-for-the-managed-domain"></a>Task 3 - Enable secure LDAP for the managed domain
To enable secure LDAP, perform the following configuration steps:

1. Navigate to the **[Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com)**.
2. Select the **Active Directory** node on the left pane.
3. Select the Azure AD directory (also referred to as 'tenant'), for which you have enabled Azure AD Domain Services.

    ![Select Azure AD Directory](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-getting-started/select-aad-directory.png)
4. Click the **Configure** tab.

    ![Configure tab of directory](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-getting-started/configure-tab.png)
5. Scroll down to the section titled **domain services**. You should see an option titled **Secure LDAP (LDAPS)** as shown in the following screenshot:

    ![Domain Services configuration section](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-start.png)
6. Click the **Configure certificate ...** button to bring up the **Configure Certificate for Secure LDAP** dialog.

    ![Configure certificate for secure LDAP](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-configure-cert-page.png)
7. Click the folder icon below **PFX FILE WITH CERTIFICATE** to specify the PFX file, which contains the certificate you wish to use for secure LDAP access to the managed domain. Also enter the password you specified when exporting the certificate to the PFX file. Then, click the done button on the bottom.

    ![Specify secure LDAP PFX file and password](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-specify-pfx.png)
8. The **domain services** section of the **Configure** tab should get grayed out and is in the **Pending...** state for a few minutes. During this period, the LDAPS certificate is verified for accuracy and secure LDAP is configured for your managed domain.

    ![Secure LDAP - pending state](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-pending-state.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to enable secure LDAP for your managed domain. If the provided secure LDAP certificate does not match the required criteria, secure LDAP is not enabled for your directory and you see a failure. For example, the domain name is incorrect, the certificate has already expired or expires soon.
   >
   >

9. When secure LDAP is successfully enabled for your managed domain, the **Pending...** message should disappear. You should see the thumbprint of the certificate displayed.

    ![Secure LDAP enabled](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-enabled.png)

## <a name="task-4---enable-secure-ldap-access-over-the-internet"></a>Task 4 - Enable secure LDAP access over the internet
**Optional task** - If you do not plan to access the managed domain using LDAPS over the internet, skip this configuration task.

Before you begin this task, ensure you have completed the steps outlined in [Task 3](#task-3---enable-secure-ldap-for-the-managed-domain).

1. You should see an option to **ENABLE SECURE LDAP ACCESS OVER THE INTERNET** in the **domain services** section of the **Configure** page. This option is set to **NO** by default since internet access to the managed domain over secure LDAP is disabled by default.

    ![Secure LDAP enabled](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-enabled2.png)
2. Toggle **ENABLE SECURE LDAP ACCESS OVER THE INTERNET** to **YES**. Click the **SAVE** button on the bottom panel.
    ![Secure LDAP enabled](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-enable-internet-access.png)
3. The **domain services** section of the **Configure** tab should get grayed out and is in the **Pending...** state for a few minutes. After some time, internet access to your managed domain over secure LDAP is enabled.

    ![Secure LDAP - pending state](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-enable-internet-access-pending-state.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > It takes about 10 minutes to enable internet access over secure LDAP for your managed domain.
   >
   >
4. When secure LDAP access to your managed domain over the internet is successfully enabled, the **Pending...** message should disappear. You should see the external IP address that can be used to access your directory over LDAPS in the field **EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS FOR LDAPS ACCESS**.

    ![Secure LDAP enabled](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-admin-guide/secure-ldap-internet-access-enabled.png)

<br>

## <a name="task-5---configure-dns-to-access-the-managed-domain-from-the-internet"></a>Task 5 - Configure DNS to access the managed domain from the internet
**Optional task** - If you do not plan to access the managed domain using LDAPS over the internet, skip this configuration task.

Before you begin this task, ensure you have completed the steps outlined in [Task 4](#task-4---enable-secure-ldap-access-over-the-internet).

Once you have enabled secure LDAP access over the internet for your managed domain, you need to update DNS so that client computers can find this managed domain. At the end of task 4, an external IP address is displayed on the **Configure** tab in **EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS FOR LDAPS ACCESS**.

Configure your external DNS provider so that the DNS name of the managed domain (for example, 'ldaps.contoso100.com') points to this external IP address. In our example, we need to create the following DNS entry:

    ldaps.contoso100.com  -> 52.165.38.113

That's it - you are now ready to connect to the managed domain using secure LDAP over the internet.

> [!WARNING]
> Remember that client computers must trust the issuer of the LDAPS certificate to be able to connect successfully to the managed domain using LDAPS. If you are using an enterprise certification authority or a publicly trusted certification authority, you do not need to do anything since client computers trust these certificate issuers. If you are using a self-signed certificate, you need to install the public part of the self-signed certificate into the trusted certificate store on the client computer.
