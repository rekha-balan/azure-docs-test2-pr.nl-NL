# <a name="enable-password-synchronization-with-azure-active-directory-domain-services"></a>Enable password synchronization with Azure Active Directory Domain Services
In the preceding tasks, you enabled Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. The next task is to enable credential hashes, which are required for NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and Kerberos authentication to sync with Azure Active Directory Domain Services. After you've set up credential synchronization, users can sign in to the managed domain with their corporate credentials.

The procedures vary depending on whether your organization has a cloud-only Azure AD tenant or is set to sync with your on-premises directory by using Azure AD Connect.

## <a name="task-5-enable-password-synchronization-with-azure-active-directory-domain-services-for-a-cloud-only-azure-ad-tenant"></a>Task 5: Enable password synchronization with Azure Active Directory Domain Services for a cloud-only Azure AD tenant
To authenticate users on the managed domain, Azure Active Directory Domain Services needs credential hashes in a format that's suitable for NTLM and Kerberos authentication. Unless you enable Azure Active Directory Domain Services for your tenant, Azure AD does not generate or store credential hashes in the format that's required for NTLM or Kerberos authentication. For obvious security reasons, Azure AD also does not store any credentials in clear-text form. Therefore, Azure AD does not have a way to generate these NTLM or Kerberos credential hashes based on users' existing credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has a cloud-only Azure AD tenant, users who need to use Azure Active Directory Domain Services must change their passwords.
>
>

This password change process causes the credential hashes that are required by Azure Active Directory Domain Services for Kerberos and NTLM authentication to be generated in Azure AD. You can either expire the passwords for all users in the tenant who need to use Azure Active Directory Domain Services or instruct them to change their passwords.

Here are the instructions you need to provide users, so they can change their passwords:

1. Go to the [Azure AD Access Panel](http://myapps.microsoft.com) page for your organization.
2. In the Access Panel window, select the **profile** tab.
3. Click the **Change password** tile.

    ![The Azure AD Access Panel "Change password" tile](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/active-directory-domain-services/media/active-directory-domain-services-getting-started/user-change-password.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the **Change password** option is not displayed in the Access Panel window, ensure that your organization has configured [password management in Azure AD](../active-directory/active-directory-passwords-getting-started.md).
   >
   >
4. On the **change password** page, type your existing (old) password, type a new password, and then confirm it.

5. Click **submit**.

A few minutes after you have changed your password, the new password is usable in Azure Active Directory Domain Services. After a few more minutes (typically, about 20 minutes), you can sign in to computers that are joined to the managed domain by using the newly changed password.
