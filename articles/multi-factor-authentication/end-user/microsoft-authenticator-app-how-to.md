# <a name="get-started-with-the-microsoft-authenticator-app"></a>Get started with the Microsoft Authenticator app
The Microsoft Authenticator app provides an additional level of security in your Azure account (for example, bsimon@contoso.onmicrosoft.com), your on-premises work account (for example, bsimon@contoso.com), or your Microsoft account (for example, bsimon@outlook.com).

The app works in one of two ways:

* **Notification**. The app can help prevent unauthorized access to accounts and stop fraudulent transactions by pushing a notification to your smartphone or tablet. Simply view the notification, and if it's legitimate, select **Verify**. Otherwise, you can select **Deny**. For information about denying notifications, see How to use the Deny and Report Fraud Feature for Multi-Factor Authentication.
* **Password with verification code**. The app can be used as a software token to generate an OAuth verification code. After you enter your username and password, you enter the code provided by the app into the sign-in screen. The verification code provides a second form of authentication.

The Microsoft Authenticator app replaces the Azure Authenticator app.  The Azure Authenticator app will continue to work, but if you decide to move to the new Microsoft Authenticator app, this article can assist you.  

## <a name="install-the-app"></a>Install the app
The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825071), [Android](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825072), and [IOS](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825073).

## <a name="add-accounts-to-the-app"></a>Add accounts to the app
For each account that you want to add to the Microsoft Authenticator app, use one of the following procedures.

### <a name="add-a-personal-microsoft-account-to-the-app"></a>Add a personal Microsoft account to the app

For a personal Microsoft account (one that you use to sign in to Outlook.com, Xbox, Skype, etc), all you have to do is sign in to your account in the Microsoft Authenticator app.

1. Go to the security verification settings screen.  For information on how to get to this screen, see [Changing your security settings](multi-factor-authentication-end-user-manage-settings.md#where-to-find-the-settings-page).
2. Check the box next to **Azure Authenticator app** then select **Configure**.

    This brings up a screen with a QR code on it.

3. Open the Microsoft Authenticator app. On the **accounts** screen, select **+**, and then specify that you want to add a work or school account.
4. Use the camera to scan the QR code, and then select **Done** to close the QR code screen.

    If your camera is not working properly, you can [enter the QR code and URL manually](#add-an-account-to-the-app-manually).

5. When the app shows your account name with a six-digit code underneath it, you're done.

    This brings up a screen with a QR code on it.  Note the code and URL.

5. Enter the code and the URL in the appropriate boxes in the app, then select **Finish**.

6. When the app shows your account name with a six-digit code underneath it, you're done.

### <a name="add-an-account-to-the-app-using-touch-id"></a>Add an account to the app using Touch ID
The Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS supports Touch ID.  Azure Multi-Factor Authentication allows organizations to require a PIN for devices. With Touch ID, iOS users donâ€™t need to enter a PIN. Instead, they can scan their fingerprint and select **Approve**.

Setting up Touch ID with Microsoft Authenticator is simple. You complete a normal verification challenge with a PIN. If your device supports Touch ID, Microsoft Authenticator will set it up automatically for that account.

![Verification of Touch ID setup](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/multi-factor-authentication/end-user/media/authenticator-app-how-to/touchid1.png)

From that point forward, when you're required to verify your sign-in, you select the received push notification and scan your fingerprint instead of entering your PIN.
