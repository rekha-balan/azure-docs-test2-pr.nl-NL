# <a name="managing-user-settings-with-azure-multi-factor-authentication-in-the-cloud"></a>Managing user settings with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud
As an administrator, you can manage the following user and device settings:

* Require selected users to provide contact methods again
* Delete users existing app passwords
* Restore MFA on all suspended devices for a user

## <a name="require-selected-users-to-provide-contact-methods-again"></a>Require selected users to provide contact methods again
This setting will forces the user to complete the registration process again when he or she signs in. Be aware that non-browser apps will continue to work if the user has app passwords for them.  You can delete the users app passwords by also selecting **Delete all existing app passwords generated by the selected users**.

### <a name="how-to-require-users-to-provide-contact-methods-again"></a>How to require users to provide contact methods again
1. Sign-in to the Azure classic portal.
2. On the left, click Active Directory.
3. Under, Directory click on the directory for the user you want to require to provide their contact method again.
4. At the top, click Users.
5. At the bottom of the page, click Manage Multi-Factor Auth. This will open the multi-factor authentication page.
6. Find the user that you wish to manage and place a check in the box located next to the name. You may need to change the view at the top.
7. This will bring up the **Manage user settings** link on the right. Click it.
8. Place a check in **Require selected users to provide contact methods again**.

## <a name="restore-mfa-on-all-remembered-devices-for-a-user"></a>Restore MFA on all remembered devices for a user
One of the configurable features of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication is giving your users the option to mark devices as trusted. For more information, see [Configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication settings](multi-factor-authentication-whats-next.md#remember-multi-factor-authentication-for-devices-that-users-trust)

Users can choose to opt out of two-step verification for a configurable number of days on their regular devices. If an account is compromised or a trusted device is lost, you need to be able to remove the trusted status and require two-step verification again.

The **Restore multi-factor authentication on all remembered devices** setting means that the user will be challenged to perform two-step verification the next time they sign in, regardless of whether they chose to mark their device as trusted. 

### <a name="how-to-restore-mfa-on-all-suspended-devices-for-a-user"></a>How to restore MFA on all suspended devices for a user
