# <a name="tutorial-monitor-azure-firewall-logs"></a>Tutorial: Monitor Azure Firewall logs

[!INCLUDE [firewall-preview-notice](../../includes/firewall-preview-notice.md)]

The examples in the Azure Firewall articles assume that you have already enabled the Azure Firewall public preview. For more information, see [Enable the Azure Firewall public preview](public-preview.md).

You can monitor Azure Firewall using firewall logs. You can also use activity logs to audit operations on Azure Firewall resources.

You can access some of these logs through the portal. Logs can be sent to [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics.md), Storage, and Event Hubs and analyzed in Log Analytics or by different tools such as Excel and Power BI.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Enable logging through the Azure portal
> * Enable logging with PowerShell
> * View and analyze the activity log
> * View and analyze the network and application rule logs

## <a name="diagnostic-logs"></a>Diagnostic logs

 The following diagnostic logs are available for Azure Firewall:

* **Application rule log**

   The Application rule log is saved to a storage account, streamed to Event hubs and/or sent to Log Analytics only if you have enabled it for each Azure Firewall. Each new connection that matches one of your configured application rules results in a log for the accepted/denied connection. The data is logged in JSON format, as shown in the following example:

   ```
   Category: access logs are either application or network rule logs.
   Time: log timestamp.
   Properties: currently contains the full message. 
   note: this field will be parsed to specific fields in the future, while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing properties field.
   ```

   ```json
   {
    "category": "AzureFirewallApplicationRule",
    "time": "2018-04-16T23:45:04.8295030Z",
    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscriptionId}/RESOURCEGROUPS/{resourceGroupName}/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/AZUREFIREWALLS/{resourceName}",
    "operationName": "AzureFirewallApplicationRuleLog",
    "properties": {
        "msg": "HTTPS request from 10.1.0.5:55640 to mydestination.com:443. Action: Allow. Rule Collection: collection1000. Rule: rule1002"
    }
   }
   ```

* **Network rule log**

   The Network rule log is saved to a storage account, streamed to Event hubs and/or sent Log Analytics only if you have enabled it for each Azure Firewall. Each new connection that matches one of your configured network rules results in a log for the accepted/denied connection. The data is logged in JSON format, as shown in the following example:

   ```
   Category: access logs are either application or network rule logs.
   Time: log timestamp.
   Properties: currently contains the full message. 
   note: this field will be parsed to specific fields in the future, while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing properties field.
   ```

   ```json
  {
    "category": "AzureFirewallNetworkRule",
    "time": "2018-06-14T23:44:11.0590400Z",
    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscriptionId}/RESOURCEGROUPS/{resourceGroupName}/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/AZUREFIREWALLS/{resourceName}",
    "operationName": "AzureFirewallNetworkRuleLog",
    "properties": {
        "msg": "TCP request from 111.35.136.173:12518 to 13.78.143.217:2323. Action: Deny"
    }
   }

   ```

You have three options for storing your logs:

* **Storage account**: Storage accounts are best used for logs when logs are stored for a longer duration and reviewed when needed.
* **Event hubs**: Event hubs are a great option for integrating with other security information and event management (SEIM) tools to get alerts on your resources.
* **Log Analytics**: Log Analytics is best used for general real-time monitoring of your application or looking at trends.

## <a name="activity-logs"></a>Activity logs

   Activity log entries are collected by default, and you can view them in the Azure portal.

   You can use [Azure activity logs](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-audit.md) (formerly known as operational logs and audit logs) to view all operations that are submitted to your Azure subscription.

## <a name="enable-diagnostic-logging-through-the-azure-portal"></a>Enable diagnostic logging through the Azure portal

It can take a few minutes for the data to appear in your logs after you complete this procedure to turn on diagnostic logging. If you don't see anything at first, check again in  a few more minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, open your firewall resource group and click the firewall.
2. Under **Monitoring**, click **Diagnostic logs**.

   For Azure Firewall, two service-specific logs are available:

   * Application rule log
   * Network rule log

3. To start collecting data, click **Turn on diagnostics**.
4. The **Diagnostics settings** page provides the settings for the diagnostic logs. 
5. In this example, Log Analytics stores the logs, so type **Firewall log analytics** for the name.
6. Click **Send to Log Analytics** to configure your workspace. You can also use event hubs and a storage account to save the diagnostic logs.
7. Under **Log Analytics**, click **Configure**.
8. In the OMS Workspaces page, click **Create New Workspace**.
9. On the **Log analytics workspace** page, type **firewall-oms** for the new **OMS Workspace** name.
10. Select your subscription, use the existing firewall resource group (**Test-FW-RG**), select **East US** for the location, and select the **Free** pricing tier.
11. Click **OK**.
   ![Starting the configuration process][1]
12. Under **Log**, click **AzureFirewallApplicationRule** and **AzureFirewallNetworkRule** to collect logs for application and network rules.
   ![Save diagnostics settings][2]
13. Click **Save**.

## <a name="enable-logging-with-powershell"></a>Enable logging with PowerShell

Activity logging is automatically enabled for every Resource Manager resource. Diagnostic logging must be enabled to start collecting the data available through those logs.

To enable diagnostic logging, use the following steps:

1. Note your storage account's resource ID, where the log data is stored. This value is of the form: */subscriptions/\<subscriptionId\>/resourceGroups/\<resource group name\>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/\<storage account name\>*.

   You can use any storage account in your subscription. You can use the Azure portal to find this information. The information is located in the resource **Property** page.

2. Note your Firewall's resource ID for which logging is enabled. This value is of the form: */subscriptions/\<subscriptionId\>/resourceGroups/\<resource group name\>/providers/Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls/\<Firewall name\>*.

   You can use the portal to find this information.

3. Enable diagnostic logging by using the following PowerShell cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting  -ResourceId /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls/<Firewall name> `
   -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage account name> `
   -Enabled $true     
    ```
    
> [!TIP] 
>Diagnostic logs do not require a separate storage account. The use of storage for access and performance logging incurs service charges.

## <a name="view-and-analyze-the-activity-log"></a>View and analyze the activity log

You can view and analyze activity log data by using any of the following methods:

* **Azure tools**: Retrieve information from the activity log through Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, the Azure REST API, or the Azure portal. Step-by-step instructions for each method are detailed in the [Activity operations with Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-audit.md) article.
* **Power BI**: If you don't already have a [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) account, you can try it for free. By using the [Azure Activity Logs content pack for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-content-pack-azure-audit-logs/), you can analyze your data with preconfigured dashboards that you can use as is or customize.

## <a name="view-and-analyze-the-network-and-application-rule-logs"></a>View and analyze the network and application rule logs

Azure [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics.md) collects the counter and event log files. It includes visualizations and powerful search capabilities to analyze your logs.

You can also connect to your storage account and retrieve the JSON log entries for access and performance logs. After you download the JSON files, you can convert them to CSV and view them in Excel, Power BI, or any other data-visualization tool.

> [!TIP]
> If you are familiar with Visual Studio and basic concepts of changing values for constants and variables in C#, you can use the [log converter tools](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/networking-dotnet-log-converter) available from GitHub.


## <a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

Now that you've configured your firewall to collect logs, you can explore Log Anaytics to view your data.
