      **Local copies of client libraries.** The Azure SDK for .NET copies to your computer the NuGet packages for some Azure client libraries, such as Storage, Service Bus, and Caching. These client libraries are automatically included in new cloud service projects, so the local NuGet packages enable Visual Studio to create projects even if you're not connected to the Internet. Client libraries are generally updated more frequently than new SDK versions are released, so the client libraries at NuGet.org are often more current than what you get with the SDK.
