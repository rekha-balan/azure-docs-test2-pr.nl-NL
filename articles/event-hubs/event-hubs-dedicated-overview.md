# <a name="overview-of-event-hubs-dedicated"></a>Overview of Event Hubs Dedicated

*Event Hubs Dedicated* capacity offers single-tenant deployments for customers with the most demanding requirements. At full scale, Azure Event Hubs can ingress over 2 million events per second or up to 2 GB per second of telemetry with fully durable storage and sub-second latency. This also enables integrated solutions by processing real-time and batch on the same system. With Event Hubs Archive included in the offering, you can reduce the complexity of your solution by having a single stream support both real-time and batch-based pipelines.

The following table compares the available service tiers of Event Hubs. The Event Hubs Dedicated offering is a fixed monthly price, compared to usage pricing for most features of Standard and Basic. The Dedicated tier offers the features of the Standard plan, but with enterprise scale capacity for customers with demanding workloads.

## <a name="benefits-of-event-hubs-dedicated-capacity"></a>Benefits of Event Hubs Dedicated capacity

The following benefits are available when using Event Hubs Dedicated:

* Single tenant hosting with no noise from other tenants.
* Message size increases to 1 MB as compared to 256 KB for Standard and Basic.
* Repeatable performance every time.
* Guaranteed capacity to meet your burst needs.
* Scalable between 1 and 8 capacity units (CU) – providing up to 2 million ingress events per second.
  * CUs manage the scale for Event Hubs Dedicated, where each CU can provide approximately the equivalent of 200 throughput units (TU).
* Zero maintenance: we manage load balancing, OS updates, security patches, and partitioning.
* Fixed monthly pricing.

Event Hubs Dedicated also removes some of the throughput limitations of the Standard offering. Throughput units in Basic and Standard tiers entitle you to 1000 events per second or 1 MBps of ingress per TU and double that amount of egress. The Dedicated scale offering has no restrictions on ingress and egress event counts. These limits are governed only by the processing capacity of the purchased event hubs.

This service is targeted at the largest telemetry users and is available to customers with an enterprise agreement.

## <a name="how-to-onboard"></a>How to onboard

The Event Hubs Dedicated platform is offered to the public through an enterprise agreement with varying sizes of CUs. Each CU provides approximately the equivalent of 200 throughput units. You can scale your capacity up or down throughout the month to meet your needs by adding or removing CUs. The dedicated plan is unique in that you will experience a more hands-on onboarding from the Event Hubs product team to get the flexible deployment that is right for you.
