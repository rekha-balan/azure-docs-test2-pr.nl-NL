> [!IMPORTANT]
> The classic deployment model supports Windows VPN clients only and uses the Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), an SSL-based VPN protocol. In order to support non-Windows VPN clients, your VNet must be created using the Resource Manager deployment model. The Resource Manager deployment model supports IKEv2 VPN in addition to SSTP. For more information, see [About P2S connections](point-to-site-about.md).
