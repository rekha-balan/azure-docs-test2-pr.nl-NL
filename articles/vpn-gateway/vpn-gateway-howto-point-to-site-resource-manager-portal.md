A Point-to-Site (P2S) configuration lets you create a secure connection from an individual client computer to a virtual network. P2S is a VPN connection over SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol). Point-to-Site connections are useful when you want to connect to your VNet from a remote location, such as from home or a conference, or when you only have a few clients that need to connect to a virtual network. P2S connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address. You establish the VPN connection from the client computer.

This article walks you through creating a VNet with a Point-to-Site connection using the Azure portal. For more information about Point-to-Site connections, see the [Point-to-Site FAQ](#faq) at the end of this article.

### <a name="example"></a>Example values
* **Name: VNet1**
* **Address space: 192.168.0.0/16**<br>For this example, we use only one address space. You can have more than one address space for your VNet.
* **Subnet name: FrontEnd**
* **Subnet address range: 192.168.1.0/24**
* **Subscription:** If you have more than one subscription, verify that you are using the correct one.
* **Resource Group: TestRG**
* **Location: East US**
* **GatewaySubnet: 192.168.200.0/24**
* **Virtual network gateway name: VNet1GW**
* **Gateway type: VPN**
* **VPN type: Route-based**
* **Public IP address: VNet1GWpip**
* **Connection type: Point-to-site**
* **Client address pool: 172.16.201.0/24**<br>VPN clients that connect to the VNet using this Point-to-Site connection receive an IP address from the client address pool.

## <a name="createvnet"></a>Part 1 - Create a virtual network
Before beginning, verify that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial). If you are creating this configuration as an exercise, you can refer to the [example values](#example).

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal-include.md)]

## <a name="address"></a>Part 2 - Specify address space and subnets
You can add additional address space and subnets to your VNet once it has been created.

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-additional-address-space](../../includes/vpn-gateway-additional-address-space-include.md)]

## <a name="gatewaysubnet"></a>Part 3 - Add a gateway subnet

Before connecting your virtual network to a gateway, you first need to create the gateway subnet for the virtual network to which you want to connect. The gateway services use the IP addresses specified in the gateway subnet. If possible, create a gateway subnet using a CIDR block of /28 or /27 to provide enough IP addresses to accommodate additional future configuration requirements.

The screenshots in this section are provided as a reference example. Be sure to use the GatewaySubnet address range that corresponds with the required values for your configuration.

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-add-gwsubnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-add-gwsubnet-rm-portal-include.md)]

## <a name="dns"></a>Part 4 - Specify a DNS server (optional)

DNS is not required for a Point-to-Site connection. However, if you want to have name resolution for resources that are deployed to your virtual network, you should specify a DNS server. This setting lets you specify the DNS server that you want to use for name resolution for this virtual network. It does not create a DNS server.

## <a name="creategw"></a>Part 5 - Create a virtual network gateway
Point-to-site connections require the following settings:

* Gateway type: VPN
* VPN type: Route-based

## <a name="generatecert"></a>Part 6 - Generate certificates

Certificates are used by Azure to authenticate VPN clients for Point-to-Site VPNs. After creating the root certificate, you export the public certificate data (not the private key) as a Base-64 encoded X.509 .cer file. You then upload the public certificate data from the root certificate to Azure.

Each client computer that connects to a VNet using Point-to-Site must have a client certificate installed. The client certificate is generated from the root certificate and installed on each client computer. If a valid client certificate is not installed and the client tries to connect to the VNet, authentication fails.

### <a name="getcer"></a>Step 1 - Obtain the .cer file for the root certificate

#### <a name="enterprise-certificate"></a>Enterprise certificate
 
If you are using an enterprise solution, you can use your existing certificate chain. Obtain the .cer file for the root certificate that you want to use.

#### <a name="self-signed-root-certificate"></a>Self-signed root certificate

If you are not using an enterprise certificate solution, you need to create a self-signed root certificate. To create a self-signed root certificate that contains the necessary fields for P2S authentication, you can use PowerShell. [Create a self-signed root certificate for Point-to-Site connections using PowerShell](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md) walks you through the steps to create a self-signed root certificate.

> [!NOTE]
> Previously, makecert was the recommended method to create self-signed root certificates and generate client certificates for Point-to-Site connections. You can now use PowerShell to create these certificates. One benefit of using PowerShell is the ability to create SHA-2 certificates. See [Create a self-signed root certificate for Point-to-Site connections using PowerShell](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md) for the required values.
>

#### <a name="to-export-the-public-key-for-a-self-signed-root-certificate"></a>To export the public key for a self-signed root certificate

Point-to-Site connections require the public key (.cer) to be uploaded to Azure. The following steps help you export the .cer file for your self-signed root certificate.

1. To obtain a .cer file from the certificate, open **Manage user certificates**.
2. Locate the 'P2SRootCert' self-signed root certificate in 'Certificates - Current User\Personal\Certificates', and right-click. Click **All Tasks**, and then click **Export** to open the **Certificate Export Wizard**.
3. In the Wizard, click **Next**. Select **No, do not export the private key**, and then click **Next**.
4. On the **Export File Format** page, select **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER).**, then click **Next**. 
5. On the **File to Export** page, Browse to 'C:', create a subdirectory called 'cert' and select it. Name the certificate file 'P2SRootCert.cer', then click **Save**. 
6. Click **Next**, then **Finish** to export the certificate. **The export was successful** appears. Click **OK** to close the wizard.

### <a name="generateclientcert"></a>Step 2 - Generate a client certificate
You can either generate a unique certificate for each client, or you can use the same certificate on multiple clients. The advantage to generating unique client certificates is the ability to revoke a single certificate. Otherwise, if everyone is using the same client certificate and you need to revoke it, you have to generate and install new certificates for all the clients that use that certificate to authenticate.

#### <a name="enterprise-certificate"></a>Enterprise certificate
- If you are using an enterprise certificate solution, generate a client certificate with the common name value format 'name@yourdomain.com', rather than the 'domain name\username' format.
- Make sure the client certificate is based on the 'User' certificate template that has 'Client Authentication' as the first item in the use list, rather than Smart Card Logon, etc. You can check the certificate by double-clicking the client certificate and viewing **Details > Enhanced Key Usage**.

#### <a name="self-signed-root-certificate"></a>Self-signed root certificate 
If you are using a self-signed root certificate, see [Generate a client certificate using PowerShell](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md#clientcert) for steps to generate a client certificate that is compatible with Point-to-Site connections.


### <a name="exportclientcert"></a>Step 3 - Export the client certificate
If you generate a client certificate from a self-signed root certificate using the [PowerShell](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md#clientcert) instructions, it's automatically installed on the computer that you used to generate it. If you want to install a client certificate on another client computer, you need to export it.
 
1. To export a client certificate, open **Manage user certificates**. Right-click the client certificate that you want to export, click **all tasks**, and then click **export** to open the **Certificate Export Wizard**.
2. In the Wizard, click **Next**, then select **Yes, export the private key**, and then click **Next**.
3. On the **Export File Format** page, leave the defaults selected. Make sure **Include all certificates in the certification path if possible** is selected to also export the required root certificate information. Then, click **Next**.
4. On the **Security** page, you must protect the private key. If you select to use a password, make sure to record or remember the password that you set for this certificate. Then, click **Next**.
5. On the **File to Export**, **Browse** to the location to which you want to export the certificate. For **File name**, name the certificate file. Then, click **Next**.
6. Click **Finish** to export the certificate.   

## <a name="addresspool"></a>Part 7 - Add the client address pool
1. Once the virtual network gateway has been created, navigate to the **Settings** section of the virtual network gateway blade. In the **Settings** section, click **Point-to-site configuration** to open the **Configuration** blade.
   
    ![Point-to-Site blade](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/configuration.png)
2. **Address pool** is the pool of IP addresses from which clients that connect receive an IP address. Add the address pool, and then click **Save**.
   
    ![Client address pool](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/ipaddresspool.png)

## <a name="uploadfile"></a>Part 8 - Upload the root certificate .cer file
After the gateway has been created, you can upload the .cer file for a trusted root certificate to Azure. You can upload files for up to 20 root certificates. You do not upload the private key for the root certificate to Azure. Once the .cer file is uploaded, Azure uses it to authenticate clients that connect to the virtual network.

1. Certificates are added on the **Point-to-site configuration** blade in the **Root certificate** section.  
2. Make sure that you exported the root certificate as a Base-64 encoded X.509 (.cer) file. You need to export the certificate in this format so you can open the certificate with text editor.
3. Open the certificate with a text editor, such as Notepad. Copy only the following section as one continuous line:
   
    ![Certificate data](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/copycert.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > When copying the certificate data, make sure that you copy the text as one continuous line without carriage returns or line feeds. You may need to modify your view in the text editor to 'Show Symbol/Show all characters' to see the carriage returns and line feeds.                                                                                                                                                                            
    >
    >

4. Paste the certificate data into the **Public Certificate Data** field. **Name** the certificate, and then click **Save**. You can add up to 20 trusted root certificates.
   
    ![Certificate upload](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/rootcertupload.png)

## <a name="clientconfig"></a>Part 9 - Download and install the VPN client configuration package
Clients connecting to Azure using P2S must have both a client certificate, and a VPN client configuration package installed. VPN client configuration packages are available for Windows clients. 

The VPN client package contains information to configure the VPN client software that is built into Windows. The configuration is specific to the VPN that you want to connect to. The package does not install additional software.

You can use the same VPN client configuration package on each client computer, as long as the version matches the architecture for the client.

### <a name="step-1---download-the-client-configuration-package"></a>Step 1 - Download the client configuration package

1. On the **Point-to-site configuration** blade, click **Download VPN client** to open the **Download VPN client** blade. It takes a minute or two for the package to generate.
   
    ![VPN client download 1](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/downloadvpnclient1.png)
2. Select the correct package for your client, and then click **Download**. Save the configuration package file. You install the VPN client configuration package on each client computer that connects to the virtual network.

    ![VPN client download 2](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/vpnclient.png)

### <a name="step-2---install-the-client-configuration-package"></a>Step 2 - Install the client configuration package

1. Copy the configuration file locally to the computer that you want to connect to your virtual network. 
2. Double-click the .exe file to install the package on the client computer. Because you created the configuration package, it is not signed and you may see a warning. If you get a Windows SmartScreen popup, click **More info** (on the left), then **Run anyway** to install the package.
3. Install the package on the client computer. If you get a Windows SmartScreen popup, click **More info** (on the left), then **Run anyway** to install the package.
4. On the client computer, navigate to **Network Settings** and click **VPN**. The VPN connection shows the name of the virtual network that it connects to.


## <a name="installclientcert"></a>Part 10 - Install an exported client certificate

If you want to create a P2S connection from a client computer other than the one you used to generate the client certificates, you need to install a client certificate. When installing a client certificate, you need the password that was created when the client certificate was exported.

1. Locate and copy the *.pfx* file to the client computer. On the client computer, double-click the *.pfx* file to install. Leave the **Store Location** as **Current User**, and then click **Next**.
2. On the **File** to import page, don't make any changes. Click **Next**.
3. On the **Private key protection** page, input the password for the certificate, or verify that the security principal is correct, and then click **Next**.
4. On the **Certificate Store** page, leave the default location, and then click **Next**.
5. Click **Finish**. On the **Security Warning** for the certificate installation, click **Yes**. You can feel comfortable clicking 'Yes' because you generated the certificate. The certificate is now successfully imported.

## <a name="connect"></a>Part 11 - Connect to Azure
 
 1. To connect to your VNet, on the client computer, navigate to VPN connections and locate the VPN connection that you created. It is named the same name as your virtual network. Click **Connect**. A pop-up message may appear that refers to using the certificate. Click **Continue** to use elevated privileges.

2. On the **Connection** status page, click **Connect** to start the connection. If you see a **Select Certificate** screen, verify that the client certificate showing is the one that you want to use to connect. If it is not, use the drop-down arrow to select the correct certificate, and then click **OK**.
   
    ![VPN client connects to Azure](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/clientconnect.png)
3. Your connection is established.
   
    ![Connection established](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/vpn-gateway/media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/connected.png)

If you are having trouble connecting, check the following items:

- Open **Manage user certificates** and navigate to **Trusted Root Certification Authorities\Certificates**. Verify that the root certificate is listed. The root certificate must be present in order for authentication to work. When you export a client certificate .pfx using the default value 'Include all certificates in the certification path if possible', the root certificate information is also exported. When you install the client certificate, the root certificate is then also installed on the client computer. 

- If you are using a certificate that was issued using an Enterprise CA solution and are having trouble authenticating, check the authentication order on the client certificate. You can check the authentication list order by double-clicking the client certificate, and going to **Details > Enhanced Key Usage**. Make sure the list shows 'Client Authentication' as the first item. If not, you need to issue a client certificate based on the User template that has Client Authentication as the first item in the list.


## <a name="verify"></a>Part 12 - Verify your connection
1. To verify that your VPN connection is active, open an elevated command prompt, and run *ipconfig/all*.
2. View the results. Notice that the IP address you received is one of the addresses within the Point-to-Site VPN Client Address Pool that you specified in your configuration. The results are similar to this example:
   
        PPP adapter VNet1:
            Connection-specific DNS Suffix .:
            Description.....................: VNet1
            Physical Address................:
            DHCP Enabled....................: No
            Autoconfiguration Enabled.......: Yes
            IPv4 Address....................: 172.16.201.3(Preferred)
            Subnet Mask.....................: 255.255.255.255
            Default Gateway.................:
            NetBIOS over Tcpip..............: Enabled


If you are having trouble connecting to a virtual machine over P2S, use 'ipconfig' to check the IPv4 address assigned to the Ethernet adapter on the computer from which you are connecting. If the IP address is within the address range of the VNet that you are connecting to, or within the address range of your VPNClientAddressPool, this is referred to as an overlapping address space. When your address space overlaps in this way, the network traffic doesn't reach Azure, it stays on the local network. If your network address spaces don't overlap and you still can't connect to your VM, see [Troubleshoot Remote Desktop connections to a VM](../virtual-machines/windows/troubleshoot-rdp-connection.md).

## <a name="add"></a>Add or remove trusted root certificates
You can add and remove trusted root certificates from Azure. When you remove a trusted certificate, the client certificates that were generated from the root certificate can't connect to Azure via Point-to-Site. If you want clients to connect, you need to install a new client certificate that is generated from a certificate that is trusted in Azure.

### <a name="to-add-a-trusted-root-certificate"></a>To add a trusted root certificate

You can add up to 20 trusted root certificate .cer files to Azure. For instructions, see the section [Upload a trusted root certificate](#uploadfile) in this article.

### <a name="to-remove-a-trusted-root-certificate"></a>To remove a trusted root certificate

1. To remove a trusted root certificate, navigate to the **Point-to-site configuration** blade for your virtual network gateway.
2. In the **Root certificate** section of the blade, locate the certificate that you want to remove.
3. Click the ellipsis next to the certificate, and then click 'Remove'.

## <a name="revokeclient"></a>Revoke a client certificate
You can revoke client certificates. The certificate revocation list allows you to selectively deny Point-to-Site connectivity based on individual client certificates. This differs from removing a trusted root certificate. If you remove a trusted root certificate .cer from Azure, it revokes the access for all client certificates generated/signed by the revoked root certificate. Revoking a client certificate, rather than the root certificate, allows the other certificates that were generated from the root certificate to continue to be used for authentication.

The common practice is to use the root certificate to manage access at team or organization levels, while using revoked client certificates for fine-grained access control on individual users.

### <a name="to-revoke-a-client-certificate"></a>To revoke a client certificate

You can revoke a client certificate by adding the thumbprint to the revocation list.

1. Retrieve the client certificate thumbprint. For more information, see [How to retrieve the Thumbprint of a Certificate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms734695.aspx).
2. Copy the information to a text editor and remove all spaces so that it is a continuous string.
3. Navigate to the virtual network gateway **Point-to-site-configuration** blade. This is the same blade that you used to [upload a trusted root certificate](#uploadfile).
4. In the **Revoked certificates** section, input a friendly name for the certificate (it doesn't have to be the certificate CN).
5. Copy and paste the thumbprint string to the **Thumbprint** field.
6. The thumbprint will validate is automatically added to the revocation list. A message appears on the screen that the list is updating. 
7. After updating has completed, the certificate can no longer be used to connect. Clients that try to connect using this certificate receive a message saying that the certificate is no longer valid.
