# <a name="import-a-power-bi-desktop-file"></a>Import a Power BI Desktop file

You can import a data model in a Power BI Desktop file (pbix) into Azure Analysis Services. Model metadata, cached data, and datasource connections are imported. Reports and visualizations are not imported. Imported data models from Power BI Desktop are at the 1400 compatibility level.

**Restrictions**   

- Importing from a pbix file uses the web designer feature in the portal, which is **preview**. Functionality is limited. For more advanced model development and testing, it's best to use Visual Studio (SSDT) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
- You must have server administrator permissions to import from a pbix file.
- The pbix model can connect to **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure SQL Data Warehouse** data sources only.
- The pbix model cannot have live or DirectQuery connections. 
- Import may fail if your pbix data model contains metadata not supported in Analysis Services.

## <a name="change-credentials"></a>Change credentials

When you import a data model from a pbix file, by default, the credentials used to connect to a datasource are set to ServiceAccount. After a model has been imported from a pbix, you can change credentials by using the following methods:

- Use the July 2018 (version 17.8.1) or later version of SSMS to edit credentials. This is the easiest way.
- Use TMSL [Alter command](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-commands/alter-command-tmsl) on the [DataSources object](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/datasources-object-tmsl) to modify the connection string property. 
- Open the model in Visual Studio, edit the credentials for the datasource connection, and then re-deploy the model.

To change credentials by using SSMS. 

1. In SSMS, expand database > **Connections**. 
2. Right-click the database connection, and then click **Refresh Credentials**.

3. In the credentials dialog, select a credential type, and enter credentials. For SQL authentication, select Database. For organization account (OAuth), select Microsoft account.

The July 2018 version of Power BI Desktop includes a new feature for changing datasource permissions. On the **Home** tab, click **Edit Queries**  > **Data source settings**. Select the datasource connection, and then click **Edit Permissions**.
