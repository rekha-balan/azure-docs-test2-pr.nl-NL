# <a name="introduction-to-azure-consistent-storage"></a>Introduction to Azure-consistent storage
Azure-consistent storage is the set of storage cloud services in Microsoft Azure Stack. Azure-consistent storage provides blob, table, queue, and account management functionality with Azure-consistent semantics. It also provides functionality to help a cloud administrator manage storage services. This article introduces Azure-consistent storage and discusses how storage cloud services in Azure Stack nicely complement the rich [software-defined storage capabilities in Windows Server 2016](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2016/04/14/ten-reasons-youll-love-windows-server-2016-5-software-defined-storage/).

Azure-consistent storage delivers the following broad categories of functionality:

* **Blobs**: page blobs, block blobs, and append blobs with   [Azure-consistent   blob](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179355.aspx#Anchor_1) behavior
* **Tables**: entities, partitions, and other table properties with   [Azure-consistent   table](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179355.aspx#Anchor_3) behavior
* **Queues**: reliable and persistent messages and queues with   [Azure-consistent   queue](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179355.aspx#Anchor_2) behavior
* **Accounts**: storage account resource management with   [Azure-consistent   account](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-create-storage-account/) behavior for general-purpose storage accounts provisioned via the [Azure   Resource Manager deployment   model](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/)
* **Administration**: management of tenant-facing and Azure-consistent storage internal   storage services (discussed in other articles)

## <a name="azure-consistent-storage-virtualized-services-and-clusters"></a>Azure-consistent storage virtualized services and clusters
In the Azure-consistent storage architecture, all tenant or administrator-accessible  storage services are virtualized. That is, they run in service provider-managed, highly available VMs based on [Hyper-V](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn765471.aspx) functionality in [Windows Server 2016](http://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/windows-server-2016/).
Although the VMs are highly available based on [Windows Server Failover Clustering](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn765474.aspx) technology, the Azure-consistent storage virtualized services themselves are guest-clustered, highly available services based on [Azure Service Fabric technology](http://azure.microsoft.com/campaigns/service-fabric/).

Azure-consistent storage employs two Service Fabric clusters in an Azure Stack deployment.
The Storage Resource Provider service is deployed on a Service Fabric cluster (“RP cluster”) that is also shared by other foundational resource provider services. The rest of the storage virtualized data path services--including the Blob, Table, and Queue services--are hosted on a second Service Fabric cluster (“Azure-consistent storage cluster”).

## <a name="blob-service-and-software-defined-storage"></a>Blob service and software-defined storage
The Blob service back end, on the other hand, runs directly on the [Scale-Out File Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831349.aspx) cluster nodes. In the Azure Stack solution architecture, Scale-Out File Server is based on the [Storage Spaces Direct](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt126109.aspx)-based, shared-nothing failover cluster. Figure 1 depicts the major Azure-consistent storage component services and their distributed deployment model. As you see in the diagram, Azure-consistent storage dovetails with existing software-defined storage features in Windows Server 2016. No special hardware is required for Azure-consistent storage beyond these Windows Server platform requirements.

## <a name="storage-farm"></a>Storage Farm
Storage Farm is the collection of storage infrastructure, resources, and back-end services that together provide tenant-facing and administrator-facing Azure-consistent storage services in an Azure Stack deployment. Specifically, Storage Farm includes the following:

* Storage hardware (for example, Scale-Out File Server nodes, disks)
* Storage fabric resources (for example, SMB shares)
* Storage-related Service Fabric services (for example, Blob endpoint service   off the Azure-consistent storage cluster)
* Storage-related services that run on Scale-Out File Server nodes (for example, the Blob service)

## <a name="iaas-and-paas-storage-usage-scenarios"></a>IaaS and PaaS storage usage scenarios
Azure-consistent storage page blobs, as in Azure, provide the virtual disks in all infrastructure as a service (IaaS) usage scenarios:

* Create a VM by using the custom OS disk in a page blob
* Create a VM by using the custom OS image in a page blob
* Create a VM by using an Azure Marketplace image in a new page blob
* Create a VM by using a blank disk in a new page blob

Similarly, for platform as a service (PaaS) scenarios, Azure-consistent storage block blobs, append blobs, queues, and tables work as they do in Azure.

## <a name="user-roles"></a>User roles
Azure-consistent storage is valuable for two user roles:

* Application owners, including developers and enterprise IT. They no longer have to maintain or deploy two versions of an application and scripts that accomplish the same job across a public cloud and a hosted/private cloud in a datacenter. Azure-consistent storage provides storage services via REST API, SDK, cmdlet, and Azure Stack portal.
* Service providers, including enterprise IT, who deploy and manage   Microsoft Azure Stack-based, multitenant storage cloud   services.
