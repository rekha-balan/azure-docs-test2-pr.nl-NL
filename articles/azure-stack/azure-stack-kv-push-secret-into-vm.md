# <a name="create-vms-and-include-certificates-retrieved-from-key-vault"></a>Create VMs and include certificates retrieved from Key Vault

> [!NOTE]
> In Technical Preview 3, you can create and manage a key vault from the [user portal](azure-stack-manage-portals.md#the-user-portal) or user API only. If you are an administrator, sign in to the user portal to access and perform operations on a key vault.

In Azure Stack, VMs are deployed through Azure Resource Manager, and you can now store certificates in Azure Stack Key Vault. Then Azure Stack (Microsoft.Compute resource provider to be specific) pushes them into your VMs when the VMs are deployed. Certificates can be used in many scenarios, including SSL, encryption, and certificate based authentication.

By using this method, you can keep the certificate safe. It's now not in the VM image, or in the application's configuration files or some other unsafe location. By setting appropriate access policy for the key vault, you can also control who gets access to your certificate. Another benefit is that you can manage all your certificates in one place in Azure Stack Key Vault.

Here is a quick overview of the process:

* You need a certificate in the .pfx format.
* Create a key vault (using either a template or the following sample script).
* Make sure you have turned on the EnabledForDeployment switch.
* Upload the certificate as a secret.

## <a name="deploying-vms"></a>Deploying VMs
This sample script creates a key vault, and then stores a certificate stored in the .pfx file in a local directory, to the key vault as a secret.

    $vaultName = "contosovault"
    $resourceGroup = "contosovaultrg"
    $location = "local"
    $secretName = "servicecert"
    $fileName = "keyvault.pfx"
    $certPassword = "abcd1234"

    # =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    $fileContentBytes = get-content $fileName -Encoding Byte

    $fileContentEncoded = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($fileContentBytes)
    $jsonObject = @"
    {
    "data": "$filecontentencoded",
    "dataType" :"pfx",
    "password": "$certPassword"
    }
    "@
    $jsonObjectBytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($jsonObject)
    $jsonEncoded = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($jsonObjectBytes)
    Switch-AzureMode -Name AzureResourceManager
    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location
    New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName $vaultName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location -sku standard -EnabledForDeployment
    $secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $jsonEncoded -AsPlainText -Force
    Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $vaultName -Name $secretName -SecretValue $secret

The first part of the script reads the .pfx file, and then stores it as a JSON object with the file content base64 encoded. Then the JSON object is also base64 encoded.

Next, it creates a new resource group and then creates a key vault. Note the last parameter to the New-AzureKeyVault command, '-EnabledForDeployment', which grants access to Azure (specifically to the Microsoft.Compute resource provider) to read secrets from the key vault for deployments.

The last command simply stores the base64 encoded JSON object in the key vault as a secret.

Here's sample output from the preceding script:

    VERBOSE:  – Created resource group 'contosovaultrg' in

    'eastus'

                      /e3391a126b65414f93f6f9806743a1f7

Now we are ready to deploy a VM template. Note the URI of the secret from the output.

You'll need a template located [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-vm-push-certificate-windows). The parameters of special interest (besides the usual VM parameters) are the vault name, the vault resource group, and the secret URI. Of course, you can also download it from GitHub and modify as needed.

When this VM is deployed, Azure injects the certificate into the VM.
On Windows, certificates in the .pfx file are added with the private key not exportable. The certificate is added to the LocalMachine certificate location, with the certificate store that the user provided. On Linux, the certificate file is placed under the /var/lib/waagent directory, with the file name &lt;UppercaseThumbprint&gt;.crt for the X509 certificate file, and &lt;UppercaseThumbprint&gt;.prv for the private key.
Both of these files are .pem formatted.

The application usually finds the certificate by using the thumbprint and doesn't need modification.

## <a name="retiring-certificates"></a>Retiring certificates
In the preceding section, we showed you how to push a new certificate to your existing VMs. But your old certificate is still in the VM and cannot be removed. For added security, you can change the attribute for old secret to 'Disabled', so that even if an old template tries to create a VM with this old version of certificate, it will. Here's how you set a specific secret version to be disabled:

    Set-AzureKeyVaultSecretAttribute -VaultName contosovault -Name servicecert -Version e3391a126b65414f93f6f9806743a1f7 -Enable 0

## <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion
With this new method, the certificate can be kept separate from the VM image or the application payload. So we have removed one point of exposure.

The certificate can also be renewed and uploaded to Key Vault without having to re-build the VM image or the application deployment package. The application still needs to be supplied with the new URI for this new certificate version though.

By separating the certificate from the VM or the application payload, we have now reduced the number of personnel that will have direct access to the certificate.

As an added benefit, you now have one convenient place in Key Vault to manage all your certificates, including the all the versions that were deployed over time.
