# <a name="install-powershell-for-azure-stack"></a>Install PowerShell for Azure Stack  

Azure Stack compatible Azure PowerShell modules are required to work with Azure Stack. In this guide, we walk you through the steps required to install PowerShell in Azure Stack by using the PowerShell commands. You can use the steps described in this article either from MAS-CON01, Azure Stack host computer, or from a Windows-based external client if you are connected through VPN.

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps require PowerShell 5.0.  To check your version, run $PSVersionTable.PSVersion and compare the "Major" version.

PowerShell commands for Azure Stack are installed from the PowerShell Gallery. To verify if PowerShell Gallery is available, open a PowerShell session on the MAS-CON01 computer or on your local computer if you are connected through VPN and run the following command:

```powershell
# Returns a list of PowerShell module repositories that are registered for the current user.
Get-PSRepository
```

Use the following steps to install PowerShell for Azure Stack:  

1. Azure Stack compatible AzureRM modules are installed through API version profiles.
To learn about API version profiles and the cmdlets provided by them, refer to the [manage API version profiles](azure-stack-version-profiles.md) article. The AzureRM.Bootstrapper module provides PowerShell commands that are required to work with API version profiles. Use the following command to install the AzureRM.Bootstrapper module:  

  ```powershell
  # Install the AzureRM.Bootstrapper module
  Install-Module -Name AzureRm.BootStrapper
  ```
2. Run the following command to install the **2017-03-09-profile** version of the AzureRM modules for Compute, Storage, Network, Key Vault etc.  

  ```powershell
  # Installs and imports the API Version Profile required by Azure Stack into the current PowerShell session.
  Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2017-03-09-profile
  ```
3. In addition to the AzureRM modules, you should also install the Azure Stack-specific PowerShell modules such as AzureStackAdmin, and AzureStackStorage by running the following command:  

  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.2.9
  ```
4. To confirm the installation, run the following command:  

  ```powershell
  Get-Module -ListAvailable | where-Object {$_.Name -like “Azure*”}
  ```
  If the installation is successful, the AzureRM and AzureStack modules are displayed in the output.
