This article answers some frequently asked questions about the Azure Stack Usage API.

## <a name="what-meter-ids-can-i-see"></a>What meter IDs can I see?
Currently, usage is reported for the network, storage, and compute resource providers.

## <a name="how-do-the-azure-stack-usage-apis-compare-to-the-azure-usage-apihttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomlibraryazure1ea5b323-54bb-423d-916f-190de96c6a3c-currently-in-public-preview"></a>How do the Azure Stack Usage APIs compare to the [Azure Usage API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/1ea5b323-54bb-423d-916f-190de96c6a3c) (currently in public preview)?
* The Tenant Usage API is consistent with the Azure API, with one exception: the *showDetails* flag currently is not supported in Azure Stack.
* The Provider Usage API applies only to Azure Stack.
* Currently, the [RateCard API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt219004.aspx) that is available in Azure is not available in Azure Stack.

## <a name="what-is-the-difference-between-usage-time-and-reported-time"></a>What is the difference between Usage Time and Reported Time?
Usage data reports have two main time values:

* **Reported Time**. The time when the usage event entered the usage system
* **Usage Time**. The time when the Azure Stack resource was consumed

You might see a discrepancy in values for Usage Time and Reported Time for a specific usage event. The delay can be as long as multiple hours in any environment.

Currently, you can query *only by Reported Time*.

## <a name="what-do-these-usage-api-error-codes-mean"></a>What do these Usage API error codes mean?
| **HTTP status code** | **Error code** | **Description** |

| 400/Bad Request |*NoApiVersion* |The *api-version* query parameter is missing. |
| 400/Bad Request |*InvalidProperty* |A property is missing or has an invalid value. The message in the error code in the response body identifies the missing property. |
