# <a name="create-a-site-to-site-vpn-connection-between-two-virtual-networks-in-different-azure-stack-poc-environments"></a>Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection between two Virtual Networks in different Azure Stack PoC Environments
## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
This article shows you how to create a Site-to-Site VPN Connection between two virtual networks in two separate Azure Stack Proof-of-Concept (POC) environments. While you configure the connections, you will learn how VPN gateways in Azure Stack work.

> [!NOTE]
> This document applies specifically to the Azure Stack TP2 POC.
> 
> 

### <a name="connection-diagram"></a>Connection diagram
The following diagram shows what the configuration should look like when you’re done:

![](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/azure-stack/media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image1.png)

### <a name="before-you-begin"></a>Before you begin
To complete this configuration, ensure you have the following items before you get started:

* Two Servers that meet the Azure Stack POC hardware requirements defined by the [Azure Stack Deployment Prerequisites](azure-stack-deploy.md), and the other prerequisites defined by that document.
* The Azure Stack Technical Preview 2 Deployment Package.

## <a name="deploy-the-poc-environments"></a>Deploy the POC environments
You will deploy two Azure Stack POC environments to complete this configuration.

* For each POC that you deploy, you can follow the deployment instructions detailed in the article [Deploy Azure Stack POC](azure-stack-run-powershell-script.md).
  Each POC environment in this document is generically referred to as *POC1* and *POC2*.

## <a name="configure-quotas-for-compute-network-and-storage"></a>Configure Quotas for Compute, Network and Storage
First, you need to configure *Quotas* for compute, network, and storage. These services can be associated with a *Plan*, and then an *Offer* that tenants can subscribe to.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to do these steps for each Azure Stack POC environment.
> 
> 

Creating Quotas for Services has changed from TP1. The steps to create quotas in TP2 can be found at <http://aka.ms/mas-create-quotas>. You can accept the defaults for all quota settings for this exercise.

## <a name="create-a-plan-and-offer"></a>Create a Plan and Offer
[Plans](azure-stack-key-features.md) are groupings of one or more services. As a provider, you can create plans to offer to your tenants. In turn, your tenants subscribe to your offers to use the plans and services they include.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to perform these steps for each Azure Stack POC environment.
> 
> 

1. First create a Plan. To do this, you can follow the steps in the [Create a Plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md) online article.
2. Create an Offer following the steps described in [Create an Offer in Azure Stack](azure-stack-create-offer.md).
3. Log in to the portal as a tenant administrator and [subscribe to the Offer you created](azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md).

## <a name="create-the-network-resources-in-poc-1"></a>Create the Network Resources in POC 1
Now you are going to actually create the resources you need to set up your configuration. The following steps illustrate what you'll be doing. These instructions show how to create resources using the portal, but the same thing can be accomplished using PowerShell.

![](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/azure-stack/media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image2.png)

### <a name="log-in-as-a-tenant"></a>Log in as a tenant
A service administrator can log in as a tenant to test the plans, offers, and subscriptions that their tenants might use. If you don’t already have one, [Create a tenant account](azure-stack-add-new-user-aad.md) before you log in.

    Keep this setting.
11. Verify that **Subscription** and **Location** are correct. You can pin the resource to the Dashboard if you like. Click **Create**.

### <a name="create-the-local-network-gateway"></a>Create the Local Network Gateway
The implementation of a *local network gateway* in this Azure Stack evaluation deployment is a bit different than in an actual Azure deployment.

Just like in Azure, you have the concept of a local network gateway. However, in an Azure deployment a local network gateway represents an on-premise (at the tenant)  physical device you use to connect to a virtual network gateway in Azure. But in this Azure Stack evaluation deployment, both ends of the connection are virtual network gateways!

A way to think about this more generically is that the Local Network Gateway resource is always meant to indicate the remote gateway at the other end of the connection. Because of the way the POC was designed, you need to provide the IP address of the external network adapter on the NAT VM of the other POC as the Public IP Address of the Local Network Gateway. You will then create NAT mappings on the NAT VM to make sure that both ends are connected properly.


### <a name="get-the-ip-address-of-the-external-adapter-of-the-nat-vm"></a>Get the IP address of the external adapter of the NAT VM
1. Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC2.

## <a name="create-a-vm"></a>Create a VM
Create a VM in POC1 now and put it on your VM subnet in your virtual network.

1. In the Azure portal, click **New**.
   
2. Select **Virtual Machines** from the Marketplace menu.
3. In the list of virtual machine images, select the **Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter** image.

## <a name="configure-the-nat-vm-in-each-poc-for-gateway-traversal"></a>Configure the NAT VM in each POC for gateway traversal
Because the POC was designed to be self-contained and isolated from the network on which the physical host is deployed, the “External” VIP network that the gateways are connected to is not actually external, but instead is hidden behind a router doing Network Address Translation (NAT). The router is actually a Windows Server VM (**MAS-BGPNAT01**) running the Routing and Remote Access Services (RRAS) role in the POC infrastructure. You must configure NAT on the MAS-BGPNAT01 VM to allow the Site-to-Site VPN Connection to connect on both ends. To do this, you must create a Static NAT mapping that maps the external interface on the BGPNAT VM to the VIP of the Edge Gateway Pool for the ports required for a VPN Connection.

> [!NOTE]
> This configuration is required for POC environments only.
> 
> 

### <a name="configure-nat"></a>Configure NAT
You need to follow these steps in BOTH POC environments.

1. Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC1.
2. Press and hold [Windows Key] + R to open the **Run** menu and type **mstsc** and press **Enter**.
3. In the **Computer** field type the name **MAS-BGPNAT01** and click **Connect**.
4. Click on the Start menu and right-click **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run As Administrator**.
5. Type **ipconfig /all**.
6. Find the Ethernet Adapter that is connected to your on-premise network, and note the IPv4 address bound to that adapter. In the example environment, it’s **10.16.169.131** (circled in red below), but yours will be different.
   
    ![](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/azure-stack/media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image16.png)
7. Type the following PowerShell command to designate the external NAT address for the ports that the IKE authentication. Remember to change the IP address to the one that matches your environment.
   
       Add-NetNatExternalAddress -NatName BGPNAT -IPAddress 10.16.169.131 -PortStart 499 -PortEnd 501
8. Next, you create a static NAT mapping to map the external  address to the Gateway Public IP Address to map the ISAKMP port 500  for PHASE 1 of the IPSEC tunnel.
   
        Add-NetNatStaticMapping -NatName BGPNAT -Protocol UDP -ExternalIPAddress 10.16.169.131 -InternalIPAddress 192.168.102.1 -ExternalPort 500 -InternalPort 500
> [!NOTE] 
> The `-InternalAddress` parameter here is the Public IP Address of the Virtual Network Gateway you created earlier.  To find this IP address, look at the properties of the Virtual Network Gateway blade, and find the value for the Public IP Address.       

9. Finally, you must configure NAT traversal which uses port 4500 to successfully establish the complete IPEC tunnel over NAT devices.
   
        Add-NetNatStaticMapping -NatName BGPNAT -Protocol UDP -ExternalIPAddress 10.16.169.131 -InternalIPAddress 192.168.102.1 -ExternalPort 4500 -InternalPort 4500
> [!NOTE] 
> The `-InternalAddress` parameter here is the Public IP Address of the Virtual Network Gateway you created earlier.  To find this IP address, look at the properties of the Virtual Network Gateway blade, and find the value for the Public IP Address.       

10. Repeat steps 1-9 in POC2.

## <a name="test-the-connection"></a>Test the connection
Now that the Site-to-Site connection has been established you should validate that you can get traffic flowing through it. This task is simple as it just involves logging in to one of the VMs you created in either POC environment and pinging the VM you created in the other environment. To ensure that you are putting the traffic through the Site-to-Site connection, you want to make sure that you ping the Direct IP (DIP) address of the VM on the remote subnet, not the VIP. To do this, you need to find and note the address on the other end of the connection.

### <a name="log-in-to-the-tenant-vm-in-poc1"></a>Log in to the tenant VM in POC1
1. Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC1, and log in to the Portal using a tenant account.
2. Click **Virtual Machines** in the left navigation bar.
3. Find **VM01** that you created previously in the list of VMs and click it.
4. On the blade for the virtual machine click **Connect**.
   
     ![](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/azure-stack/media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image17.png)
5. Open a Command prompt from inside the VM and type **ipconfig /all**.
6. Find the **IPv4 Address** in the output and note it. This is the address you will ping from POC2. In the example environment, the address is **10.0.10.4**, but in your environment it might be different. It should however fall within the **10.0.10.0/24** subnet that was created previously.

### <a name="log-in-to-the-tenant-vm-in-poc2"></a>Log in to the tenant VM in POC2
1. Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC2 and log in to the portal using a tenant account.
2. Click **Virtual Machines** in the left navigation bar.
3. Find **VM02** that you created previously in the list of VMs and click it.
4. On the blade for the virtual machine click **Connect**.
   
5. Open a Command prompt from inside the VM and type **ipconfig /all**.
6. You should see an IPv4 address that falls within 10.0.20.0/24. In the example environment, the address is 10.0.20.4, but yours might be different.
7. Now from the VM in POC2 you want to ping the VM in POC1, through the tunnel. To do this you ping the DIP that you recorded from VM01.
   In the example environment this is 10.0.10.4, but be sure to ping the address you noted in your lab. You should see a result that looks like this:
   
    ![](https://docstestmedia1.blob.core.windows.net/azure-media/articles/azure-stack/media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image19b.png)
8. A reply from the remote VM indicates a successful test! You can close the VM Connect window. Or you can try doing some other data transfers like a file copy to test your connection.

### <a name="viewing-data-transfer-statistics-through-the-gateway-connection"></a>Viewing data transfer statistics through the gateway connection
If you want to know how much data is passing through your Site-to-Site connection, this information is available in the Connection blade. This test is also another good way to verify that the ping you just sent actually went through the VPN connection.

1. While still logged in to tenant VM in POC2, log in to the **Microsoft Azure Stack POC Portal** using your tenant account.
2. Click the **Browse** menu item and select **Connections**.
3. Click the **POC2-POC1** connection in the list.
4. On the Connection blade, you can see statistics for **Data in** and **Data out**. In the following screen shot you see some larger numbers than just a ping will create. That’s because of some additional file transfers as well. You should see some non-zero values there.
