# <a name="manage-key-vault-using-cli-20"></a>Manage Key Vault using CLI 2.0
Azure Key Vault is available in most regions. For more information, see the [Key Vault pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/).

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
Use this tutorial to help you get started with Azure Key Vault to create a hardened container (a vault) in Azure, to store and manage cryptographic keys and secrets in Azure. It walks you through the process of using Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface to create a vault that contains a key or password that you can then use with an Azure application. It then shows you how an application can then use that key or password.

**Estimated time to complete:** 20 minutes

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial does not include instructions on how to write the Azure application that one of the steps includes, which shows how to authorize an application to use a key or secret in the key vault.
>
> This tutorial uses the latest Azure CLI 2.0. For instructions using older (node.js based) CLI refer to [this equivalent tutorial](key-vault-manage-with-cli.md).
>
>

For overview information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](key-vault-whatis.md)

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

* A subscription to Microsoft Azure. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).
* Command-Line Interface version 2.0 or later. To install the latest version and connect to your Azure subscription, see [Install and Configure the Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* An application that will be configured to use the key or password that you create in this tutorial. A sample application is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45343). For instructions, see the accompanying Readme file.

## <a name="getting-help-with-azure-cross-platform-command-line-interface"></a>Getting help with Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface
This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt)

The --help or -h parameter can be used to view help for specific commands. Alternately, The azure help [command] [options] format can also be used to return the same information. For example, the following commands all return the same information:

```
az account set --help
az account set -h
```

When in doubt about the parameters needed by a command, refer to help using --help, -h or az help [command].

You can also read the following tutorials to get familiar with Azure Resource Manager in Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface:

* [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* [Get started with Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli)

## <a name="connect-to-your-subscriptions"></a>Connect to your subscriptions
To log in using an organizational account, use the following command:

```
az login -u username@domain.com -p password
```

or if you want to log in by typing interactively

```
az login
```

If you have multiple subscriptions and want to specify a specific one to use for Azure Key Vault, type the following to see the subscriptions for your account:

```
az account list
```

Then, to specify the subscription to use, type:

```
az account set --subscription <subscription name or ID>
```

For more information about configuring Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## <a name="create-a-new-resource-group"></a>Create a new resource group
When using Azure Resource Manager, all related resources are created inside a resource group. We will create a new resource group 'ContosoResourceGroup' for this tutorial.

```
az group create -n 'ContosoResourceGroup' -l 'East Asia'
```

The first parameter is resource group name and the second parameter is the location. For location, use the command `az account list-locations` to identify how to specify an alternative location to the one in this example. If you need more information, type: `az account list-locations -h`.

## <a name="register-the-key-vault-resource-provider"></a>Register the Key Vault resource provider
Make sure that Key Vault resource provider is registered in your subscription:

```
az provider register -n Microsoft.KeyVault
```

This only needs to be done once per subscription.

## <a name="create-a-key-vault"></a>Create a key vault
Use the `az keyvault create` command to create a key vault. This script has three mandatory parameters: a resource group name, a key vault name, and the geographic location.

For example, if you use the vault name of ContosoKeyVault, the resource group name of ContosoResourceGroup, and the location of East Asia, type:
```
az keyvault create --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --resource-group 'ContosoResourceGroup' --location 'East Asia'
```

The output of this command shows properties of the key vault that you've just created. The two most important properties are:

* **name**: In the example this is ContosoKeyVault. You will use this name for other Key Vault commands.
* **vaultUri**: In the example this is https://contosokeyvault.vault.azure.net. Applications that use your vault through its REST API must use this URI.

Your Azure account is now authorized to perform any operations on this key vault. As yet, nobody else is.

## <a name="add-a-key-or-secret-to-the-key-vault"></a>Add a key or secret to the key vault
If you want Azure Key Vault to create a software-protected key for you, use the `az key create` command, and type the following:
```
az keyvault key create --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault' --name 'ContosoFirstKey' --protection software
```
However, if you have an existing key in a .pem file saved as local file in a file named softkey.pem that you want to upload to Azure Key Vault, type the following to import the key from the .PEM file, which protects the key by software in the Key Vault service:
```
az keyvault key import --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault' --name 'ContosoFirstKey' --pem-file './softkey.pem' --pem-password 'PaSSWORD' --protection software
```
You can now reference the key that you created or uploaded to Azure Key Vault, by using its URI. Use  **https://ContosoKeyVault.vault.azure.net/keys/ContosoFirstKey** to always get the current version, and use **https://ContosoKeyVault.vault.azure.net/keys/ContosoFirstKey/cgacf4f763ar42ffb0a1gca546aygd87** to get this specific version.

To add a secret to the vault, which is a password named SQLPassword and that has the value of Pa$$w0rd to Azure Key Vault, type the following:
```
az keyvault secret set --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault' --name 'SQLPassword' --value 'Pa$$w0rd'
```
You can now reference this password that you added to Azure Key Vault, by using its URI. Use **https://ContosoVault.vault.azure.net/secrets/SQLPassword** to always get the current version, and use **https://ContosoVault.vault.azure.net/secrets/SQLPassword/90018dbb96a84117a0d2847ef8e7189d** to get this specific version.

Let's view the key or secret that you just created:

* To view your key, type: `az keyvault key list --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault'`
* To view your secret, type: `az keyvault secret list --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault'`

## <a name="register-an-application-with-azure-active-directory"></a>Register an application with Azure Active Directory
This step would usually be done by a developer, on a separate computer. It is not specific to Azure Key Vault but is included here, for completeness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete the tutorial, your account, the vault, and the application that you will register in this step must all be in the same Azure directory.
>
>

Applications that use a key vault must authenticate by using a token from Azure Active Directory. To do this, the owner of the application must first register the application in their Azure Active Directory. At the end of registration, the application owner gets the following values:

* An **Application ID** (also known as a Client ID) and **authentication key** (also known as the shared secret). The application must present both of these values to Azure Active Directory, to get a token. How the application is configured to do this depends on the application. For the Key Vault sample application, the application owner sets these values in the app.config file.

To register the application in Azure Active Directory:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. On the left, click **Azure Active Directory**, and then select the directory in which you will register your application. <br> <br> Note: You must select the same directory that contains the Azure subscription with which you created your key vault. If you do not know which directory this is, click **Settings**, identify the subscription with which you created your key vault, and note the name of the directory displayed in the last column.
3. Click **APPLICATIONS**. If no apps have been added to your directory, this page will show only the **Add an App** link. Click the link, or alternatively, you can click the **ADD** on the command bar.
4. In the **ADD APPLICATION** wizard, on the **What do you want to do?** page, click **Add an application my organization is developing**.
5. On the **Tell us about your application** page, specify a name for your application and select **WEB APPLICATION AND/OR WEB API** (the default). Click the Next icon.
6. On the **App properties** page, specify the **SIGN-ON URL** and **APP ID URI** for your web application. If your application does not have these values, you can make them up for this step (for example, you could specify http://test1.contoso.com for both boxes). It does not matter if these sites exist; what is important is that the app ID URI for each application is different for every application in your directory. The directory uses this string to identify your app.
7. Click the Complete icon to save your changes in the wizard.
8. On the Quick Start page, click **CONFIGURE**.
9. Scroll to the **keys** section, select the duration, and then click **SAVE**. The page refreshes and now shows a key value. You must configure your application with this key value and the **CLIENT ID** value. (Instructions for this configuration will be application-specific.)
10. Copy the client ID value from this page, which you will use in the next step to set permissions on your vault.

## <a name="authorize-the-application-to-use-the-key-or-secret"></a>Authorize the application to use the key or secret
To authorize the application to access the key or secret in the vault, use the `az keyvault set-policy` command.

For example, if your vault name is ContosoKeyVault and the application you want to authorize has a client ID of 8f8c4bbd-485b-45fd-98f7-ec6300b7b4ed, and you want to authorize the application to decrypt and sign with keys in your vault, then run the following:
```
az keyvault set-policy --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --spn 8f8c4bbd-485b-45fd-98f7-ec6300b7b4ed --key-permissions decrypt sign
```

If you want to authorize that same application to read secrets in your vault, run the following:
```
az keyvault set-policy --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --spn 8f8c4bbd-485b-45fd-98f7-ec6300b7b4ed --secret-permissions get
```
## <a name="if-you-want-to-use-a-hardware-security-module-hsm"></a>If you want to use a hardware security module (HSM)
For added assurance, you can import or generate keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) that never leave the HSM boundary. The HSMs are FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated. If this requirement doesn't apply to you, skip this section and go to [Delete the key vault and associated keys and secrets](#delete-the-key-vault-and-associated-keys-and-secrets).

To create these HSM-protected keys, you must have a vault subscription that supports HSM-protected keys.

When you create the keyvault, add the 'sku' parameter:

```
az keyvault create --name 'ContosoKeyVaultHSM' --resource-group 'ContosoResourceGroup' --location 'East Asia' --sku 'Premium'
```
You can add software-protected keys (as shown earlier) and HSM-protected keys to this vault. To create an HSM-protected key, set the Destination parameter to 'HSM':

```
az keyvault key create --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVaultHSM' --name 'ContosoFirstHSMKey' --protection 'hsm'
```

You can use the following command to import a key from a .pem file on your computer. This command imports the key into HSMs in the Key Vault service:

```
az keyvault key import --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVaultHSM' --name 'ContosoFirstHSMKey' --pem-file '/.softkey.pem' --protection 'hsm' --pem-password 'PaSSWORD'
```
The next command imports a “bring your own key" (BYOK) package. This lets you generate your key in your local HSM, and transfer it to HSMs in the Key Vault service, without the key leaving the HSM boundary:

```
az keyvault key import --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVaultHSM' --name 'ContosoFirstHSMKey' --byok-file './ITByok.byok' --protection 'hsm'
```
For more detailed instructions about how to generate this BYOK package, see [How to use HSM-Protected Keys with Azure Key Vault](key-vault-hsm-protected-keys.md).

## <a name="delete-the-key-vault-and-associated-keys-and-secrets"></a>Delete the key vault and associated keys and secrets
If you no longer need the key vault and the key or secret that it contains, you can delete the key vault by using the `az keyvault delete` command:

```
az keyvault delete --name 'ContosoKeyVault'
```

Or, you can delete an entire Azure resource group, which includes the key vault and any other resources that you included in that group:

```
az group delete --name 'ContosoResourceGroup'
```

## <a name="other-azure-cross-platform-command-line-interface-commands"></a>Other Azure Cross-Platform Command-line Interface Commands
Other commands that you might useful for managing Azure Key Vault.

This command lists a tabular display of all keys and selected properties:

az keyvault key list --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault'

This command displays a full list of properties for the specified key:

az keyvault key show --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault' --name 'ContosoFirstKey'

This command lists a tabular display of all secret names and selected properties:

az keyvault secret list --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault'

Here's an example of how to remove a specific key:

az keyvault key delete --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault' --name 'ContosoFirstKey'

Here's an example of how to remove a specific secret:

az keyvault secret delete --vault-name 'ContosoKeyVault' --name 'SQLPassword'
