> [!NOTE]
> Azure Backup Server can now protect VMware VMs and provides improved security capabilities. You need to install the product as explained in the below sections and apply Update 1 and the latest Azure Backup Agent. To learn more about VMware backup using Azure Backup server please visit the [how-to blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/four-simple-steps-to-backup-vmware-vms-using-azure-backup-server/). To learn about security capabilities , refer to [Azure backup security features documentation](backup-azure-security-feature.md).
