# <a name="designing-vm-scale-sets-for-scale"></a>Designing VM Scale Sets For Scale
This topic discusses design considerations for Virtual Machine Scale Sets. For information about what Virtual Machine Scale Sets are, refer to [Virtual Machine Scale Sets Overview](virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview.md).

## <a name="storage"></a>Storage

### <a name="scale-sets-with-azure-managed-disks"></a>Scale sets with Azure Managed Disks
Scale sets can be now created with [Azure Managed Disks](../storage/storage-managed-disks-overview.md). Managed Disks provide the following benefits:
- You do not have to pre-create a set of Azure storage accounts for the scale set VMs.
- You can define [attached data disks](virtual-machine-scale-sets-attached-disks.md) for the VMs in your scale set.
- Scale sets can be configured to [support up to 1,000 VMs in a set](virtual-machine-scale-sets-placement-groups.md). 

You can create scale sets with Managed Disks starting with version "2016-04-30-preview" of the Azure Compute API. For information on converting a scale set template to Managed Disks, refer to [Convert a scale set template to a managed disk scale set template](virtual-machine-scale-sets-convert-template-to-md.md).

### <a name="user-managed-storage"></a>User-managed Storage
A scale set which is not defined with Azure Managed Disks relies on user-created storage accounts to store the OS disks of the VMs in the set. A ratio of 20 VMs per storage account or less is recommended to achieve maximum IO and also take advantage of _overprovisioning_ (see below). It is also recommended that you spread the beginning characters of the storage account names across the alphabet. Doing so helps spread load across different internal systems. 

>[!NOTE]
>VM Scale Sets API version `2016-04-30-preview` supports using Azure Managed Disks for the Operating System disk and any extra data disks. For more information, see [Managed Disks Overview](../storage/storage-managed-disks-overview.md) and [Use Attached Data Disks](virtual-machine-scale-sets-attached-disks.md). 

## <a name="overprovisioning"></a>Overprovisioning
Starting with the "2016-03-30" API version, VM Scale Sets default to "overprovisioning" VMs. With overprovisioning turned on, the scale set actually spins up more VMs than you asked for, then deletes the extra VMs once the requested number of VMs are successfully provisioned. Overprovisioning improves provisioning success rates and reduces deployment time. You are not billed for the extra VMs, and they do not count toward your quota limits.

While overprovisioning does improve provisioning success rates, it can cause confusing behavior for an application that is not designed to handle extra VMs appearing and then disappearing. To turn overprovisioning off, ensure you have the following string in your template: "overprovision": "false". More details can be found in the [VM Scale Set REST API documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt589035.aspx).

If your scale set uses user-managed storage, and you turn off overprovisioning, you can have more than 20 VMs per storage account, but it is not recommended to go above 40 for IO performance reasons. 

## <a name="limits"></a>Limits
A scale set built on a Marketplace image (also known as a platform image) and configured to use Azure Managed Disks supports a capacity of up to 1,000 VMs. If you configure your scale set to support more than 100 VMs, not all scenarios work the same (for example load balancing). For more information, see [Working with large virtual machine scale sets](virtual-machine-scale-sets-placement-groups.md). 

A scale set configured with user-managed storage accounts is currently limited to 100 VMs (and 5 storage accounts are recommended for this scale).

A scale set built on a custom image (one built by you) can have a capacity of up to 100 VMs when configured with Azure Managed disks. If the scale set is configured with user-managed storage accounts, it must create all OS disk VHDs within one storage account. As a result, the maximum recommended number of VMs in a scale set built on a custom image and user-managed storage is 20. If you turn off overprovisioning, you can go up to 40.

For more VMs than these limits allow, you need to deploy multiple scale sets as shown in [this template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/301-custom-images-at-scale).
