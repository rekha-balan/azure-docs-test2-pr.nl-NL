Azure App Services complies with the key industry standards for security and reliability to provide our customers a secure platform. We have several easy-to-use features to help secure both inbound and outbound traffic for your app. We also help customers secure their application code by providing externally provided functionality to scan your web application for vulnerabilities.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-blueprint-security](../../includes/app-service-blueprint-security.md)]

Azure App Service uses the same Antimalware solution used by Azure Cloud Services and Virtual Machines. To learn more about this refer to our [Antimalware documentation](../security/azure-security-antimalware.md).
