# <a name="event-grid-message-delivery-and-retry"></a>Event Grid message delivery and retry 

This article describes how Azure Event Grid handles events when delivery isn't acknowledged.

Event Grid provides durable delivery. It delivers each message at least once for each subscription. Events are sent to the registered webhook of each subscription immediately. If a webhook doesn't acknowledge receipt of an event within 60 seconds of the first delivery attempt, Event Grid retries delivery of the event. 

Currently, Event Grid sends each event individually to subscribers. The subscriber receives an array with a single event.

## <a name="message-delivery-status"></a>Message delivery status

Event Grid uses HTTP response codes to acknowledge receipt of events. 

### <a name="success-codes"></a>Success codes

The following HTTP response codes indicate that an event has been delivered successfully to your webhook. Event Grid considers delivery complete.

- 200 OK
- 202 Accepted

### <a name="failure-codes"></a>Failure codes

The following HTTP response codes indicate that an event delivery attempt failed.

- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 404 Not Found
- 408 Request timeout
- 413 Request Entity Too Large
- 414 URI Too Long
- 429 Too Many Requests
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 503 Service Unavailable
- 504 Gateway Timeout

If you have [configured a dead-letter endpoint](manage-event-delivery.md) and Event Grid receives either a 400 or 413 response code, Event Grid immediately sends the event to the dead-letter endpoint. Otherwise, Event Grid retries all errors.

## <a name="retry-intervals-and-duration"></a>Retry intervals and duration

Event Grid uses an exponential backoff retry policy for event delivery. If your webhook doesn't respond or returns a failure code, Event Grid retries delivery on the following schedule:

1. 10 seconds
2. 30 seconds
3. 1 minute
4. 5 minutes
5. 10 minutes
6. 30 minutes
7. 1 hour

Event Grid adds a small randomization to all retry intervals. After one hour, event delivery is retried once an hour.

By default, Event Grid expires all events that aren't delivered within 24 hours. You can [customize the retry policy](manage-event-delivery.md) when creating an event subscription. You provide the maximum number of delivery attempts (default is 30) and the event time-to-live (default is 1440 minutes).

## <a name="dead-letter-events"></a>Dead-letter events

When Event Grid can't deliver an event, it can send the undelivered event to a storage account. This process is known as dead-lettering. To see undelivered events, you can pull them from the dead-letter location. For more information, see [Dead letter and retry policies](manage-event-delivery.md).
